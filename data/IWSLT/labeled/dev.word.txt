the first half of the 20th century was an absolute disaster in human affairs a cataclysm we had the first world war the great depression the second world war and the rise of the communist nations and each one of these forces split the world tore the world apart divided the world and they threw up walls [UNK] political walls trade walls transportation walls communication walls iron curtains [UNK] which divided peoples and nations it was only in the second half of the 20th century that we slowly began to pull ourselves out of this abyss trade walls began to come tumbling down here are some data on tariffs starting at 40 percent coming down to less than 5 percent we globalized the world and what does that mean it means that we extended cooperation across national boundaries we made the world more cooperative transportation walls came tumbling down you know in 1950 the typical ship carried 5,000 to 10,000 tons worth of goods today a container ship can carry 150,000 tons it can be manned with a smaller crew and unloaded faster than ever before communication walls i do n't have to tell you [UNK] the internet [UNK] have come tumbling down and of course the iron curtains political walls have come tumbling down now all of this has been tremendous for the world trade has increased here is just a little bit of data in 1990 exports from china to the united states 15 billion dollars by 2007 over 300 billion dollars and perhaps most remarkably at the beginning of the 21st century really for the first time in modern history growth extended to almost all parts of the world so china i 've already mentioned beginning around 1978 around the time of the death of mao growth [UNK] ten percent a year year after year after year absolutely incredible never before in human history have so many people been raised out of such great poverty as happened in china china is the world 's greatest anti-poverty program over the last three decades india starting a little bit later but in 1990 begetting tremendous growth incomes at that time less than $ 1,000 per year and over the next 18 years have almost tripled growth of six percent a year absolutely incredible now africa sub-saharan africa [UNK] sub-saharan africa has been the area of the world most resistant to growth and we can see the tragedy of africa in the first few bars here growth was negative people were actually getting poorer than their parents and sometimes even poorer than their grandparents had been but at the end of the 20th century the beginning of the 21st century we saw growth in africa and i think as you 'll see there 's reasons for optimism because i believe that the best is yet to come now why on the cutting edge today it 's new ideas which are driving growth and by that i mean it 's products for which the research and development costs are really high and the manufacturing costs are low more than ever before it is these types of ideas which are driving growth on the cutting edge now ideas have this amazing property thomas jefferson i think really expressed this quite well he said " he who receives an idea from me receives instruction himself without lessening mine as he who lights his candle at mine receives light without darkening me or to put it slightly differently one apple feeds one man but an idea can feed the world " now this is not new this is practically not new to tedsters this is practically the model of ted but what is new is that the greater function of ideas is going to drive growth even more than ever before this provides a reason why trade and globalization are even more important more powerful than ever before and are going to increase growth more than ever before and to explain why this is so i have a question suppose that there are two diseases one of them is rare the other one is common but if they are not treated they are equally severe if you had to choose which would you rather have the common disease or the rare disease common the common [UNK] i think that 's absolutely right and why because there are more drugs to treat common diseases than there are to treat rare diseases the reason for this is incentives it costs about the same to produce a new drug whether that drug treats 1,000 people 100,000 people or a million people but the revenues are much greater if the drug treats a million people so the incentives are much larger to produce drugs which treat more people to put this differently larger markets save lives in this case misery truly does love company now think about the following if china and india were as rich as the united states is today the market for cancer drugs would be eight times larger than it is now now we are not there yet but it is happening as other countries become richer the demand for these pharmaceuticals is going to increase tremendously and that means an increase incentive to do research and development which benefits everyone in the world larger markets increase the incentive to produce all kinds of ideas whether it 's software whether it 's a computer chip whether it 's a new design for the hollywood people in the audience this even explains why action movies have larger budgets than comedies it 's because action movies translate easier into other languages and other cultures so the market for those movies is larger people are willing to invest more and the budgets are larger alright well if larger markets increase the incentive to produce new ideas how do we maximize that incentive it 's by having one world market by globalizing the world the way i like to put this is one idea ideas are meant to be shared so one idea can serve one world one market one idea one world one market well how else can we create new ideas that 's one reason globalize trade how else can we create new ideas well more idea creators now idea creators they come from all walks of life artists and innovators [UNK] many of the people you 've seen on this stage i 'm going to focus on scientists and engineers because i have some data on that and i 'm a data person now today less than one-tenth of one percent of the world 's population are scientists and engineers the united states has been an idea leader a large fraction of those people are in the united states but the u.s. is losing its idea leadership and for that i am very grateful that is a good thing it is fortunate that we are becoming less of an idea leader because for too long the united states and a handful of other developed countries have shouldered the entire burden of research and development but consider the following if the world as a whole were as wealthy as the united states is now there would be more than five times as many scientists and engineers contributing to ideas which benefit everyone which are shared by everyone i think of the great indian mathematician ramanujan how many ramanujans are there in india today toiling in the fields barely able to feed themselves when they could be feeding the world now we 're not there yet but it is going to happen in this century the real tragedy of the last century is this if you think about the world 's population as a giant computer a massively parallel processor then the great tragedy has been that billions of our processors have been off line but in this century china is coming on line india is coming on line africa is coming on line we will see an einstein in africa in this century here is just some data this is china 1996 less than one million new university students in china per year 2006 over five million now think what this means this means we all benefit when another country gets rich we should not fear other countries becoming wealthy that is something that we should embrace [UNK] a wealthy china a wealthy india a wealthy africa we need a greater demand for ideas [UNK] those larger markets i was talking about earlier [UNK] and a greater supply of ideas for the world now you can see some of the reasons why i 'm optimistic globalization is increasing the demand for ideas the incentive to create new ideas investments in education are increasing the supply of new ideas in fact if you look at world history you can see some reasons for optimism from about the beginnings of humanity to 1500 zero economic growth nothing 1500 to 1800 maybe a little bit of economic growth but less in a century than you expect to see in a year today 1900s maybe one percent twentieth century a little bit over two percent twenty-first century could easily be 3.3 even higher percent even at that rate by 2100 average gdp per capita in the world will be $ 200,000 that 's not u.s. gdp per capita which will be over a million but world gdp per capita [UNK] $ 200,000 that 's not that far we wo n't make it but some of our grandchildren probably will and i should say i think this is a rather modest prediction in kurzweilian terms this is gloomy in kurzweilian terms i 'm like the eeyore of economic growth alright what about problems what about a great depression here is gdp per capita from 1900 to 1929 now let 's imagine that you were an economist in 1929 trying to forecast future growth for the united states not knowing that the economy was about to go off a cliff not knowing that we were about to enter the greatest economic disaster certainly in the 20th century what would you have predicted not knowing this if you had based your prediction your forecast on 1900 to 1929 you 'd have predicted something like this if you 'd been a little more optimistic [UNK] say based upon the roaring twenties [UNK] you 'd have said this so what actually happened we went off a cliff but we recovered in fact in the second half of the 20th century growth was even higher than anything you would have predicted based upon the first half of the 20th century so growth can wash away even what appears to be a great depression alright what else oil oil this was a big topic when i was writing up my notes oil was $ 140 per barrel so people were asking a question they were saying " is china drinking our milkshake " and there is some truth to this in the sense that we have something of a finite resource and increased growth is going to push up demand for that but i think i do n't have to tell this audience that a higher price of oil is not necessarily a bad thing moreover as everyone knows look [UNK] it 's energy not oil which counts and higher oil prices mean a greater incentive to invest in energy r & amp d you can see this in the data as oil prices go up energy patents go up the world is much better equipped to overcome an increase in the price of oil today than ever in the past because of what i 'm talking about one idea one world one market so i 'm optimistic so long as we hew to these two ideas to keep globalizing world markets keep extending cooperation across national boundaries and keep investing in education now the united states has a particularly important role to play in this to keep our education system globalized to keep our education system open to students from all over the world because our education system is the candle that other students come to light their own candles now remember here what jefferson said jefferson said " when they come and light their candles at ours they gain light and we are not darkened " but jefferson was n't quite right was he because the truth is when they light their candles at ours there is twice as much light available for everyone so my view is be optimistic spread the ideas spread the light thank you .the story i wanted to share with you today is my challenge as an iranian artist as an iranian woman artist as an iranian woman artist living in exile well it has its pluses and minuses on the dark side politics does n't seem to escape people like me every iranian artist in one form or another is political politics have defined our lives if you 're living in iran you 're facing censorship harassment arrest torture [UNK] at times execution if you 're living outside like me you 're faced with life in exile [UNK] the pain of the longing and the separation from your loved ones and your family therefore we do n't find the moral emotional psychological and political space to distance ourselves from the reality of social responsibility oddly enough an artist such as myself finds herself also in the position of being the voice the speaker of my people even if i have indeed no access to my own country also people like myself we 're fighting two battles on different grounds we 're being critical of the west the perception of the west about our identity [UNK] about the image that is constructed about us about our women about our politics about our religion we are there to take pride and insist on respect and at the same time we 're fighting another battle that is our regime our government [UNK] our atrocious government [ that ] has done every crime in order to stay in power our artists are at risk we are in a position of danger we pose a threat to the order of the government but ironically this situation has empowered all of us because we are considered as artists central to the cultural political social discourse in iran we are there to inspire to provoke to mobilize to bring hope to our people we are the reporters of our people and are communicators to the outside world art is our weapon culture is a form of resistance i envy sometimes the artists of the west for their freedom of expression for the fact that they can distance themselves from the question of politics from the fact that they are only serving one audience mainly the western culture but also i worry about the west because often in this country in this western world that we have culture risks being a form of entertainment our people depend on our artists and culture is beyond communication my journey as an artist started from a very very personal place i did not start to make social commentary about my country the first one that you see in front of you is actually when i first returned to iran after being separated for a good 12 years it was after the islamic revolution of 1979 while i was absent from iran the islamic revolution had descended on iran and had entirely transformed the country from persian to the islamic culture i came mainly to be reunited with my family and to reconnect in a way that i found my place in the society but instead i found a country that was totally ideological and that i did n't recognize anymore more so i became very interested as i was facing my own personal dilemmas and questions i became immersed in the study of the islamic revolution [UNK] how indeed it had incredibly transformed the lives of iranian women i found the subject of iranian women immensely interesting in the way the women of iran historically seemed to embody the political transformation so in a way by studying a woman you can read the structure and the ideology of the country so i made a group of work that at once faced my own personal questions in life and yet it brought my work into a larger discourse [UNK] the subject of martyrdom the question of those who willingly stand in that intersection of love of god faith but violence and crime and cruelty for me this became incredibly important and yet i had an unusual position toward this i was an outsider who had come back to iran to find my place but i was not in a position to be critical of the government or the ideology of the islamic revolution this changed slowly as i found my voice and i discovered things that i did n't know i would discover so my art became slightly more critical my knife became a little sharper and i fell into a life in exile i am a nomadic artist i work in morocco in turkey in mexico i go everywhere to make believe it 's iran now i am making films last year i finished a film called " women without men " " women without men " returns to history but another part of our iranian history it goes to 1953 when american cia exercised a coup and removed a democratically elected leader dr. mossadegh the book is written by an iranian woman shahrnush parsipur it 's a magical realist novel this book is banned and she spent five years in prison my obsession with this book and the reason i made this into a film is because it at once was addressing the question of being a female [UNK] traditionally historically in iran [UNK] and the question of four women who are all looking for an idea of change freedom and democracy [UNK] while the country of iran equally as if another character also struggled for an idea of freedom and democracy and independence from the foreign interventions i made this film because i felt it 's important for it to speak to the westerners about our history as a country that all of you seem to remember iran after the islamic revolution that iran was once a secular society and we had democracy and this democracy was stolen from us by the american government by the british government this film also speaks to the iranian people in asking them to return to their history and look at themselves before they were so islamicized [UNK] in the way we looked in the way we played music in the way we had intellectual life and most of all in the way that we fought for democracy these are some of the shots actually from my film these are some of the images of the coup and we made this film in casablanca recreating all the shots this film tried to find a balance between telling a political story but also a feminine story being a visual artist indeed i am foremost interested to make art [UNK] to make art that transcends politics religion the question of feminism and become an important timeless universal work of art the challenge i have is how to do that how to tell a political story but an allegorical story how to move you with your emotions but also make your mind work these are some of the images and the characters of the film now comes the green movement [UNK] the summer of 2009 as my film is released [UNK] the uprising begins in the streets of tehran what is unbelievably ironic is the period that we tried to depict in the film the cry for democracy and social justice repeats itself now again in tehran the green movement significantly inspired the world it brought a lot of attention to all those iranians who stand for basic human rights and struggle for democracy what was most significant for me was once again the presence of the women they 're absolutely inspirational for me if in the islamic revolution the images of the woman portrayed were submissive and did n't have a voice now we saw a new idea of feminism in the streets of tehran [UNK] women who were educated forward thinking non-traditional sexually open fearless and seriously feminist these women and those young men united iranians across the world inside and outside i then discovered why i take so much inspiration from iranian women that under all circumstances they have pushed the boundary they have confronted the authority they have broken every rule in the smallest and the biggest way and once again they proved themselves i stand here to say that iranian women have found a new voice and their voice is giving me my voice and it 's a great honor to be an iranian woman and an iranian artist even if i have to operate in the west only for now thank you so much .hawa abdi many people [UNK] 20 years for somalia [UNK] [ were ] fighting so there was no job no food children most of them became very malnourished like this deqo mohamed so as you know always in a civil war the ones affected most [ are ] the women and children so our patients are women and children and they are in our backyard it 's our home we welcome them that 's the camp that we have in now 90,000 people where 75 percent of them are women and children pat mitchell and this is your hospital this is the inside ha we are doing c-sections and different operations because people need some help there is no government to protect them dm every morning we have about 400 patients maybe more or less but sometimes we are only five doctors and 16 nurses and we are physically getting exhausted to see all of them but we take the severe ones and we reschedule the other ones the next day it is very tough and as you can see it 's the women who are carrying the children it 's the women who come into the hospitals it 's the women [ are ] building the houses that 's their house and we have a school this is our bright [UNK] we opened [ in the ] last two years [ an ] elementary school where we have 850 children and the majority are women and girls pm and the doctors have some very big rules about who can get treated at the clinic would you explain the rules for admission ha the people who are coming to us we are welcoming we are sharing with them whatever we have but there are only two rules first rule there is no clan distinguished and political division in somali society [ whomever ] makes those things we throw out the second no man can beat his wife if he beat we will put [ him ] in jail and we will call the eldest people until they identify this case we 'll never release him that 's our two rules the other thing that i have realized that the woman is the most strong person all over the world because the last 20 years the somali woman has stood up they were the leaders and we are the leaders of our community and the hope of our future generations we are not just the helpless and the victims of the civil war we can reconcile we can do everything dm as my mother said we are the future hope and the men are only killing in somalia so we came up with these two rules in a camp with 90,000 people you have to come up with some rules or there is going to be some fights so there is no clan division and no man can beat his wife and we have a little storage room where we converted a jail so if you beat your wife you 're going to be there so empowering the women and giving the opportunity [UNK] we are there for them they are not alone for this pm you 're running a medical clinic it brought much much needed medical care to people who would n't get it you 're also running a civil society you 've created your own rules in which women and children are getting a different sense of security talk to me about your decision dr. abdi and your decision dr. mohamed to work together [UNK] for you to become a doctor and to work with your mother in these circumstances ha my age [UNK] because i was born in 1947 [UNK] we were having at that time government law and order but one day i went to the hospital [UNK] my mother was sick [UNK] and i saw the hospital how they [ were ] treating the doctors how they [ are ] committed to help the sick people i admired them and i decided to become a doctor my mother died unfortunately when i was 12 years [ old ] then my father allowed me to proceed [ with ] my hope my mother died in [ a ] gynecology complication so i decided to become a gynecology specialist that 's why i became a doctor so dr. deqo has to explain dm for me my mother was preparing [ me ] when i was a child to become a doctor but i really did n't want to maybe i should become an historian or maybe a reporter i loved it but it did n't work when the war broke out [UNK] civil war [UNK] i saw how my mother was helping and how she really needed the help and how the care is essential to the woman to be a woman doctor in somalia and help the women and children and i thought maybe i can be a reporter and doctor gynecologist so i went to russia and my mother also [ during the ] time of [ the ] soviet union so some of our character maybe we will come with a strong soviet background of training so that 's how i decided [ to do ] the same my sister was different she 's here she 's also a doctor she graduated in russia also and to go back and to work with our mother is just what we saw in the civil war [UNK] when i was 16 and my sister was 11 when the civil war broke out so it was the need and the people we saw in the early '90s [UNK] that 's what made us go back and work for them pm so what is the biggest challenge working mother and daughter in such dangerous and sometimes scary situations ha yes i was working in a tough situation very dangerous and when i saw the people who needed me i was staying with them to help because i [ could ] do something for them most people fled abroad but i remained with those people and i was trying to do something [UNK] [ any ] little thing i [ could ] do i succeeded in my place now my place is 90,000 people who are respecting each other who are not fighting but we try to stand on our feet to do something little things we can for our people and i 'm thankful for my daughters when they come to me they help me to treat the people to help they do everything for them they have done what i desire to do for them pm what 's the best part of working with your mother and the most challenging part for you dm she 's very tough it 's most challenging she always expects us to do more and really when you think [ you ] can not do it she will push you and i can do it that 's the best part she shows us trains us how to do and how to be better [ people ] and how to do long hours in surgery [UNK] 300 patients per day 10 20 surgeries and still you have to manage the camp [UNK] that 's how she trains us it is not like beautiful offices here 20 patients you 're tired you see 300 patients 20 surgeries and 90,000 people to manage pm but you do it for good reasons wait wait ha thank you dm thank you ha thank you very much dm thank you very much .aids was discovered 1981 the virus 1983 these gapminder bubbles show you how the spread of the virus was in 1983 in the world or how we estimate that it was what we are showing here is [UNK] on this axis here i 'm showing percent of infected adults and on this axis i 'm showing dollars per person in income and the size of these bubbles the size of the bubbles here that shows how many are infected in each country and the color is the continent now you can see united states in 1983 had a very low percentage infected but due to the big population still a sizable bubble there were quite many people infected in the united states and up there you see uganda they had almost five percent infected and quite a big bubble in spite of being a small country then and they were probably the most infected country in the world now what has happened now you have understood the graph and now in the next 60 seconds we will play the hiv epidemic in the world but first i have a new invention here i have solidified the beam of the laser pointer so ready steady go 1 first we have the fast rise in uganda and zimbabwe they went upwards like this in asia the first country to be heavily infected was thailand [UNK] they reached one to two percent then uganda started to turn back whereas zimbabwe skyrocketed and some years later south africa had a terrible rise of hiv frequency look india got many infected but had a low level and almost the same happens here see uganda coming down zimbabwe coming down russia went to one percent in the last two to three years we have reached a steady state of hiv epidemic in the world 25 years it took but steady state does n't mean that things are getting better it 's just that they have stopped getting worse and it has [UNK] the steady state is more or less one percent of the adult world population is hiv-infected it means 30 to 40 million people the whole of california [UNK] every person that 's more or less what we have today in the world now let me make a fast replay of botswana botswana [UNK] upper middle-income country in southern africa democratic government good economy and this is what happened there they started low they skyrocketed they peaked up there in 2003 and now they are down but they are falling only slowly because in botswana with good economy and governance they can manage to treat people and if people who are infected are treated they do n't die of aids these percentages wo n't come down because people can survive 10 to 20 years so there 's some problem with these metrics now but the poorer countries in africa the low-income countries down here there the rates fall faster of the percentage infected because people still die in spite of pepfar the generous pepfar all people are not reached by treatment and of those who are reached by treatment in the poor countries only 60 percent are left on treatment after two years it 's not realistic with lifelong treatment for everyone in the poorest countries but it 's very good that what is done is being done but focus now is back on prevention it is only by stopping the transmission that the world will be able to deal with it drugs is too costly [UNK] had we had the vaccine or when we will get the vaccine that 's something more effective [UNK] but the drugs are very costly for the poor not the drug in itself but the treatment and the care which is needed around it so when we look at the pattern one thing comes out very clearly you see the blue bubbles and people say hiv is very high in africa i would say hiv is very different in africa you 'll find the highest hiv rate in the world in african countries and yet you 'll find senegal down here [UNK] the same rate as united states and you 'll find madagascar and you 'll find a lot of african countries about as low as the rest of the world it 's this terrible simplification that there 's one africa and things go on in one way in africa we have to stop that it 's not respectful and it 's not very clever to think that way i had the fortune to live and work for a time in the united states i found out that salt lake city and san francisco were different and so it is in africa [UNK] it 's a lot of difference so why is it so high is it war no it 's not look here war-torn congo is down there [UNK] two three four percent and this is peaceful zambia neighboring country [UNK] 15 percent and there 's good studies of the refugees coming out of congo [UNK] they have two three percent infected and peaceful zambia [UNK] much higher there are now studies clearly showing that the wars are terrible that rapes are terrible but this is not the driving force for the high levels in africa so is it poverty well if you look at the macro level it seems more money more hiv but that 's very simplistic so let 's go down and look at tanzania i will split tanzania in five income groups from the highest income to the lowest income and here we go the ones with the highest income the better off [UNK] i would n't say rich [UNK] they have higher hiv the difference goes from 11 percent down to four percent and it is even bigger among women there 's a lot of things that we thought that now good research done by african institutions and researchers together with the international researchers show that that 's not the case so this is the difference within tanzania and i ca n't avoid showing kenya look here at kenya i 've split kenya in its provinces here it goes see the difference within one african country [UNK] it goes from very low level to very high level and most of the provinces in kenya is quite modest so what is it then why do we see this extremely high levels in some countries well it is more common with multiple partners there is less condom use and there is age-disparate sex [UNK] that is older men tend to have sex with younger women we see higher rates in younger women than younger men in many of these highly affected countries but where are they situated i will swap the bubbles to a map look the highly infected are four percent of all population and they hold 50 percent of the hiv-infected hiv exists all over the world look you have bubbles all over the world here brazil has many hiv-infected arab countries not so much but iran is quite high they have heroin addiction and also prostitution in iran india has many because they are many southeast asia and so on but there is one part of africa [UNK] and the difficult thing is at the same time not to make a uniform statement about africa not to come to simple ideas of why it is like this on one hand on the other hand try to say that this is not the case because there is a scientific consensus about this pattern now unaids have done good data available finally about the spread of hiv it could be concurrency it could be some virus types it could be that there is other things which makes transmission occur in a higher frequency after all if you are completely healthy and you have heterosexual sex the risk of infection in one intercourse is one in 1,000 do n't jump to conclusions now on how to behave tonight and so on but [UNK] and if you are in an unfavorable situation more sexually transmitted diseases it can be one in 100 but what we think is that it could be concurrency and what is concurrency in sweden we have no concurrency we have serial monogamy vodka new year 's eve [UNK] new partner for the spring vodka midsummer 's eve [UNK] new partner for the fall vodka [UNK] and it goes on like this you know and you collect a big number of exes and we have a terrible chlamydia epidemic [UNK] terrible chlamydia epidemic which sticks around for many years hiv has a peak three to six weeks after infection and therefore having more than one partner in the same month is much more dangerous for hiv than others probably it 's a combination of this and what makes me so happy is that we are moving now towards fact when we look at this you can get this chart free we have uploaded unaids data on the gapminder site and we hope that when we act on global problems in the future we will not only have the heart we will not only have the money but we will also use the brain thank you very much .as a particle physicist i study the elementary particles and how they interact on the most fundamental level for most of my research career i 've been using accelerators such as the electron accelerator at stanford university just up the road to study things on the smallest scale but more recently i 've been turning my attention to the universe on the largest scale because as i 'll explain to you the questions on the smallest and the largest scale are actually very connected so i 'm going to tell you about our twenty-first-century view of the universe what it 's made of and what the big questions in the physical sciences are [UNK] at least some of the big questions so recently we have realized that the ordinary matter in the universe [UNK] and by ordinary matter i mean you me the planets the stars the galaxies [UNK] the ordinary matter makes up only a few percent of the content of the universe almost a quarter or approximately a quarter of the matter in the universe is stuff that 's invisible by invisible i mean it does n't absorb in the electromagnetic spectrum it does n't emit in the electromagnetic spectrum it does n't reflect it does n't interact with the electromagnetic spectrum which is what we use to detect things it does n't interact at all so how do we know it 's there we know it 's there by its gravitational effects in fact this dark matter dominates the gravitational effects in the universe on a large scale and i 'll be telling you about the evidence for that what about the rest of the pie the rest of the pie is a very mysterious substance called dark energy more about that later ok so for now let 's turn to the evidence for dark matter in these galaxies especially in a spiral galaxy like this most of the mass of the stars is concentrated in the middle of the galaxy this huge mass of all these stars keeps stars in circular orbits in the galaxy so we have these stars going around in circles like this as you can imagine even if you know physics this should be intuitive ok [UNK] that stars that are closer to the mass in the middle will be rotating at a higher speed than those that are further out here ok so what you would expect is that if you measured the orbital speed of the stars that they should be slower on the edges than on the inside in other words if we measured speed as a function of distance [UNK] this is the only time i 'm going to show a graph ok [UNK] we would expect that it goes down as the distance increases from the center of the galaxy when those measurements are made instead what we find is that the speed is basically constant as a function of distance if it 's constant that means that the stars out here are feeling the gravitational effects of matter that we do not see in fact this galaxy and every other galaxy appears to be embedded in a cloud of this invisible dark matter and this cloud of matter is much more spherical than the galaxy themselves and it extends over a much wider range than the galaxy so we see the galaxy and fixate on that but it 's actually a cloud of dark matter that 's dominating the structure and the dynamics of this galaxy galaxies themselves are not strewn randomly in space they tend to cluster and this is an example of a very actually famous cluster the coma cluster and there are thousands of galaxies in this cluster they 're the white fuzzy elliptical things here so these galaxy clusters [UNK] we take a snapshot now we take a snapshot in a decade it 'll look identical but these galaxies are actually moving at extremely high speeds they 're moving around in this gravitational potential well of this cluster ok so all of these galaxies are moving we can measure the speeds of these galaxies their orbital velocities and figure out how much mass is in this cluster and again what we find is that there is much more mass there than can be accounted for by the galaxies that we see or if we look in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum we see that there 's a lot of gas in this cluster as well but that can not account for the mass either in fact there appears to be about ten times as much mass here in the form of this invisible or dark matter as there is in the ordinary matter ok it would be nice if we could see this dark matter a little bit more directly i 'm just putting this big blue blob on there ok to try to remind you that it 's there can we see it more visually yes we can and so let me lead you through how we can do this so here 's an observer it could be an eye it could be a telescope and suppose there 's a galaxy out here in the universe how do we see that galaxy a ray of light leaves the galaxy and travels through the universe for perhaps billions of years before it enters the telescope or your eye now how do we deduce where the galaxy is well we deduce it by the direction that the ray is traveling as it enters our eye right we say the ray of light came this way the galaxy must be there ok now suppose i put in the middle a cluster of galaxies [UNK] and do n't forget the dark matter ok now if we consider a different ray of light one going off like this we now need to take into account what einstein predicted when he developed general relativity and that was that the gravitational field due to mass will deflect not only the trajectory of particles but will deflect light itself so this light ray will not continue in a straight line but would rather bend and could end up going into our eye where will this observer see the galaxy you can respond up right we extrapolate backwards and say the galaxy is up here is there any other ray of light that could make into the observer 's eye from that galaxy yes great i see people going down like this so a ray of light could go down be bent up into the observer 's eye and the observer sees a ray of light here now take into account the fact that we live in a three-dimensional universe ok a three-dimensional space are there any other rays of light that could make it into the eye yes 1 the rays would lie on a [UNK] i 'd like to see [UNK] yeah on a cone so there 's a whole ray of light [UNK] rays of light on a cone [UNK] that will all be bent by that cluster and make it into the observer 's eye if there is a cone of light coming into my eye what do i see a circle a ring it 's called an einstein ring einstein predicted that ok now it will only be a perfect ring if the source the deflector and the eyeball in this case are all in a perfectly straight line if they 're slightly skewed we 'll see a different image now you can do an experiment tonight over the reception ok to figure out what that image will look like because it turns out that there is a kind of lens that we can devise that has the right shape to produce this kind of effect we call this gravitational lensing and so this is your instrument ok but ignore the top part it 's the base that i want you to concentrate ok so actually at home whenever we break a wineglass i save the bottom take it over to the machine shop we shave it off and i have a little gravitational lens ok so it 's got the right shape to produce the lensing and so the next thing you need to do in your experiment is grab a napkin i grabbed a piece of graph paper [UNK] i 'm a physicist so a napkin draw a little model galaxy in the middle and now put the lens over the galaxy and what you 'll find is that you 'll see a ring an einstein ring now move the base off to the side and the ring will split up into arcs ok and you can put it on top of any image on the graph paper you can see how all the lines on the graph paper have been distorted and again this is a kind of an accurate model of what happens with the gravitational lensing ok so the question is do we see this in the sky do we see arcs in the sky when we look at say a cluster of galaxies and the answer is yes and so here 's an image from the hubble space telescope many of the images you are seeing are earlier from the hubble space telescope well first of all for the golden shape galaxies [UNK] those are the galaxies in the cluster they 're the ones that are embedded in that sea of dark matter that are causing the bending of the light to cause these optical illusions or mirages practically of the background galaxies so the streaks that you see all these streaks are actually distorted images of galaxies that are much further away so what we can do then is based on how much distortion we see in those images we can calculate how much mass there must be in this cluster and it 's an enormous amount of mass and also you can tell by eye by looking at this that these arcs are not centered on individual galaxies they are centered on some more spread out structure and that is the dark matter in which the cluster is embedded ok so this is the closest you can get to kind of seeing at least the effects of the dark matter with your naked eye ok so a quick review then to see that you 're following so the evidence that we have that a quarter of the universe is dark matter [UNK] this gravitationally attracting stuff [UNK] is that galaxies the speed with which stars orbiting galaxies is much too large it must be embedded in dark matter the speed with which galaxies within clusters are orbiting is much too large it must be embedded in dark matter and we see these gravitational lensing effects these distortions that say that again clusters are embedded in dark matter ok so now let 's turn to dark energy so to understand the evidence for dark energy we need to discuss something that stephen hawking referred to in the previous session and that is the fact that space itself is expanding so if we imagine a section of our infinite universe [UNK] and so i 've put down four spiral galaxies ok [UNK] and imagine that you put down a set of tape measures so every line on here corresponds to a tape measure horizontal or vertical for measuring where things are if you could do this what you would find that with each passing day each passing year each passing billions of years ok the distance between galaxies is getting greater and it 's not because galaxies are moving away from each other through space they 're not necessarily moving through space they 're moving away from each other because space itself is getting bigger ok that 's what the expansion of the universe or space means so they 're moving further apart now what stephen hawking mentioned as well is that after the big bang space expanded at a very rapid rate but because gravitationally attracting matter is embedded in this space it tends to slow down the expansion of the space ok so the expansion slows down with time so in the last century ok people debated about whether this expansion of space would continue forever whether it would slow down you know will be slowing down but continue forever slow down and stop asymptotically stop or slow down stop and then reverse so it starts to contract again so a little over a decade ago two groups of physicists and astronomers set out to measure the rate at which the expansion of space was slowing down ok by how much less is it expanding today compared to say a couple of billion years ago the startling answer to this question ok from these experiments was that space is expanding at a faster rate today than it was a few billion years ago ok so the expansion of space is actually speeding up this was a completely surprising result there is no persuasive theoretical argument for why this should happen ok no one was predicting ahead of time this is what 's going to be found it was the opposite of what was expected so we need something to be able to explain that now it turns out in the mathematics you can put it in as a term that 's an energy but it 's a completely different type of energy from anything we 've ever seen before we call it dark energy and it has this effect of causing space to expand but we do n't have a good motivation for putting it in there at this point ok so it 's really unexplained as to why we need to put it in now so at this point then what i want to really emphasize to you is that first of all dark matter and dark energy are completely different things ok there are really two mysteries out there as to what makes up most of the universe and they have very different effects dark matter because it gravitationally attracts it tends to encourage the growth of structure ok so clusters of galaxies will tend to form because of all this gravitational attraction dark energy on the other hand is putting more and more space between the galaxies makes it the gravitational attraction between them decrease and so it impedes the growth of structure so by looking at things like clusters of galaxies and how they [UNK] their number density how many there are as a function of time [UNK] we can learn about how dark matter and dark energy compete against each other in structure forming in terms of dark matter i said that we do n't have any you know really persuasive argument for dark energy do we have anything for dark matter and the answer is yes we have well-motivated candidates for the dark matter now what do i mean by well motivated i mean that we have mathematically consistent theories that were actually introduced to explain a completely different phenomenon ok things that i have n't even talked about that each predict the existence of a very weakly interacting new particle so this is exactly what you want in physics where a prediction comes out of a mathematically consistent theory that was actually developed for something else but we do n't know if either of those are actually the dark matter candidate ok one or both who knows or it could be something completely different now we look for these dark matter particles because after all they are here in the room ok and they did n't come in the door they just pass through anything they can come through the building through the earth [UNK] they 're so non-interacting so one way to look for them is to build detectors that are extremely sensitive to a dark matter particle coming through and bumping it so a crystal that will ring if that happens so one of my colleagues up the road and his collaborators have built such a detector and they 've put it deep down in an iron mine in minnesota ok deep under the ground and in fact in the last couple of days announced the most sensitive results so far they have n't seen anything ok but it puts limits on what the mass and the interaction strength of these dark matter particles are there 's going to be a satellite telescope launched later this year and it will look towards the middle of the galaxy to see if we can see dark matter particles annihilating and producing gamma rays that could be detected with this the large hadron collider a particle physics accelerator that we 'll be turning on later this year it is possible that dark matter particles might be produced at the large hadron collider now because they are so non-interactive they will actually escape the detector so their signature will be missing energy ok now unfortunately there is a lot of new physics whose signature could be missing energy so it will be hard to tell the difference and finally for future endeavors there are telescopes being designed specifically to address the questions of dark matter and dark energy [UNK] ground-based telescopes and there are three space-based telescopes that are in competition right now to be launched to investigate dark matter and dark energy so in terms of the big questions what is dark matter what is dark energy the big questions facing physics and i 'm sure you have lots of questions which i very much look forward to addressing over the next 72 hours while i 'm here thank you .the brilliant playwright adrienne kennedy wrote a volume called " people who led to my plays " and if i were to write a volume it would be called " artists who have led my exhibitions " because my work in understanding art and in understanding culture has come by following artists by looking at what artists mean and what they do and who they are j.j. from " good times " significant to many people of course because of " dy-no-mite " but perhaps more significant as the first really black artist on primetime tv jean-michel basquiat important to me because [ he was ] the first black artist in real time that showed me the possibility of who and what i was about to enter into my overall project is about art [UNK] specifically about black artists [UNK] very generally about the way in which art can change the way we think about culture and ourselves my interest is in artists who understand and rewrite history who think about themselves within the narrative of the larger world of art but who have created new places for us to see and understand i 'm showing two artists here glenn ligon and carol walker two of many who really form for me the essential questions that i wanted to bring as a curator to the world i was interested in the idea of why and how i could create a new story a new narrative in art history and a new narrative in the world and to do this i knew that i had to see the way in which artists work understand the artist 's studio as a laboratory imagine then reinventing the museum as a think tank and looking at the exhibition as the ultimate white paper [UNK] asking questions providing the space to look and to think about answers in 1994 when i was a curator at the whitney museum i made an exhibition called black male it looked at the intersection of race and gender in contemporary american art it sought to express the ways in which art could provide a space for dialogue [UNK] complicated dialogue dialogue with many many points of entry [UNK] and how the museum could be the space for this contest of ideas this exhibition included over 20 artists of various ages and races but all looking at black masculinity from a very particular point of view what was significant about this exhibition is the way in which it engaged me in my role as a curator as a catalyst for this dialogue one of the things that happened very distinctly in the course of this exhibition is i was confronted with idea of how powerful images can be and people 's understanding of themselves and each other i 'm showing you two works one on the right by leon golub one on the left by robert colescott and in the course of the exhibition [UNK] which was contentious controversial and ultimately for me life-changing in my sense of what art could be [UNK] a woman came up to me on the gallery floor to express her concern about the nature of how powerful images could be and how we understood each other and she pointed to the work on the left to tell me how problematic this image was as it related for her to the idea of how black people had been represented and she pointed to the image on the right as an example to me of the kind of dignity that needed to be portrayed to work against those images in the media she then assigned these works racial identities basically saying to me that the work on the right clearly was made by a black artist the work on the left clearly by a white artist when in effect that was the opposite case bob colescott african-american artist leon golub a white artist the point of that for me was to say [UNK] in that space in that moment [UNK] that i really more than anything wanted to understand how images could work how images did work and how artists provided a space bigger than one that we could imagine in our day-to-day lives to work through these images fast-forward and i end up in harlem home for many of black america very much the psychic heart of the black experience really the place where the harlem renaissance existed harlem now sort of explaining and thinking of itself in this part of the century looking both backwards and forwards 1 i always say harlem is an interesting community because unlike many other places it thinks of itself in the past present and the future simultaneously no one speaks of it just in the now it 's always what it was and what it can be and in thinking about that then my second project the second question i ask is can a museum be a catalyst in a community can a museum house artists and allow them to be change agents as communities rethink themselves this is harlem actually on january 20th thinking about itself in a very wonderful way so i work now at the studio museum in harlem thinking about exhibitions there thinking about what it means to discover art 's possibility now what does this mean to some of you in some cases i know that many of you are involved in cross-cultural dialogues you 're involved in ideas of creativity and innovation think about the place that artists can play in that [UNK] that is the kind of incubation and advocacy that i work towards in working with young black artists think about artists not as content providers though they can be brilliant at that but again as real catalysts the studio museum was founded in the late 60s and i bring this up because it 's important to locate this practice in history to look at 1968 in the incredible historic moment that it is and think of the arc that has happened since then to think of the possibilities that we are all privileged to stand in today and imagine that this museum that came out of a moment of great protest and one that was so much about examining the history and the legacy of important african-american artists to the history of art in this country like jacob lawrence norman lewis romare bearden and then of course to bring us to today in 1975 muhammad ali gave a lecture at harvard university after his lecture a student got up and said to him " give us a poem " and mohammed ali said " me we " a profound statement about the individual and the community the space in which now in my project of discovery of thinking about artists of trying to define what might be black art cultural movement of the 21st century what that might mean for cultural movements all over this moment the " me we " seems incredibly prescient totally important to this end the specific project that has made this possible for me is a series of exhibitions all titled with an f [UNK] freestyle frequency and flow [UNK] which have set out to discover and define the young black artists working in this moment who i feel strongly will continue to work over the next many years this series of exhibitions was made specifically to try and question the idea of what it would mean now at this point in history to see art as a catalyst what it means now at this point in history as we define and redefine culture black culture specifically in my case but culture generally i named this group of artists around an idea which i put out there called post-black really meant to define them as artists who came and start their work now looking back at history but start in this moment historically it is really in this sense of discovery that i have a new set of questions that i 'm asking what does it mean right now to be african-american in america what can artwork say about this where can a museum exist as the place for us all to have this conversation really most exciting about this is thinking about the energy and the excitement that young artists can bring their works for me are about not always just simply about the aesthetic innovation that their minds imagine that their visions create and put out there in the world but more perhaps importantly through the excitement of the community that they create as important voices that would allow us right now to understand our situation as well as in the future i am continually amazed by the way in which the subject of race can take itself in many places that we do n't imagine it should be i am always amazed by the way in which artists are willing to do that in their work it is why i look to art it 's why i ask questions of art it is why i make exhibitions now this exhibition as i said 40 young artists done over the course of eight years and for me it 's about considering the implications it 's considering the implications of what this generation has to say to the rest of us it 's considering what it means for these artists to be both out in the world as their work travels but in their communities as people who are seeing and thinking about the issues that face us it 's also about thinking about the creative spirit and nurturing it and imagining particularly in urban america about the nurturing of the spirit now where perhaps does this end up right now for me it is about re-imagining this cultural discourse in an international context so the last iteration of this project has been called flow with the idea now of creating a real network of artists around the world really looking not so much from harlem and out but looking across and flow looked at artists all born on the continent of africa and as many of us think about that continent and think about what if means to us all in the 21st century i have begun that looking through artists through artworks and imagining what they can tell us about the future what they tell us about our future and what they create in their sense of offering us this great possibility of watching that continent emerge as part of our bigger dialogue so what do i discover when i look at artworks what do i think about when i think about art i feel like the privilege i 've had as a curator is not just the discovery of new works the discovery of exciting works but really it has been what i 've discovered about myself and what i can offer in the space of an exhibition to talk about beauty to talk about power to talk about ourselves and to talk and speak to each other that 's what makes me get up every day and want to think about this generation of black artists and artists around the world thank you .i want to start with a story a la seth godin from when i was 12 years old my uncle ed gave me a beautiful blue sweater [UNK] at least i thought it was beautiful and it had fuzzy zebras walking across the stomach and mount kilimanjaro and mount meru were kind of right across the chest that were also fuzzy and i wore it whenever i could thinking it was the most fabulous thing i owned until one day in ninth grade when i was standing with a number of the football players and my body had clearly changed and matt mussolina who was undeniably my nemesis in high school said in a booming voice that we no longer had to go far away to go on ski trips but we could all ski on mount novogratz and i was so humiliated and mortified that i immediately ran home to my mother and chastised her for ever letting me wear the hideous sweater we drove to the goodwill and we threw the sweater away somewhat ceremoniously my idea being that i would never have to think about the sweater nor see it ever again fast forward [UNK] 11 years later i 'm a 25-year-old kid i 'm working in kigali rwanda jogging through the steep slopes when i see 10 feet in front of me a little boy [UNK] 11 years old [UNK] running toward me wearing my sweater and i 'm thinking no this is not possible but so curious i run up to the child [UNK] of course scaring the living bejesus out of him [UNK] grab him by the collar turn it over and there is my name written on the collar of this sweater i tell that story because it has served and continues to serve as a metaphor to me about the level of connectedness that we all have on this earth we so often do n't realize what our action and our inaction does to people we think we will never see and never know i also tell it because it tells a larger contextual story of what aid is and can be that this traveled into the goodwill in virginia and moved its way into the larger industry which at that point was giving millions of tons of secondhand clothing to africa and asia which was a very good thing providing low cost clothing and at the same time certainly in rwanda it destroyed the local retailing industry not to say that it should n't have but that we have to get better at answering the questions that need to be considered when we think about consequences and responses so i 'm going to stick in rwanda circa 1985 1986 where i was doing two things i had started a bakery with 20 unwed mothers we were called the " bad news bears " and our notion was we were going to corner the snack food business in kigali which was not hard because there were no snacks before us and because we had a good business model we actually did it and i watched these women transform on a micro-level but at the same time i started a micro-finance bank and tomorrow iqbal quadir is going to talk about grameen which is the grandfather of all micro-finance banks which now is a worldwide movement [UNK] you talk about a meme [UNK] but then it was quite new especially in an economy that was moving from barter into trade we got a lot of things right we focused on a business model we insisted on skin in the game the women made their own decisions at the end of the day as to how they would use this access to credit to build their little businesses earn more income so they could take care of their families better what we did n't understand what was happening all around us with the confluence of fear ethnic strife and certainly an aid game if you will that was playing into this invisible but certainly palpable movement inside rwanda that at that time 30 percent of the budget was all foreign aid the genocide happened in 1994 seven years after these women all worked together to build this dream and the good news was that the institution the banking institution lasted in fact it became the largest rehabilitation lender in the country the bakery was completely wiped out but the lessons for me were that accountability counts [UNK] got to build things with people on the ground using business models where as steven levitt would say the incentives matter understand however complex we may be incentives matter so when chris raised to me how wonderful everything that was happening in the world that we were seeing a shift in zeitgeist on the one hand i absolutely agree with him and i was so thrilled to see what happened with the g8 [UNK] that the world because of people like tony blair and bono and bob geldof [UNK] the world is talking about global poverty the world is talking about africa in ways i have never seen in my life it 's thrilling and at the same time what keeps me up at night is a fear that we 'll look at the victories of the g8 [UNK] 50 billion dollars in increased aid to africa 40 billion in reduced debt [UNK] as the victory as more than chapter one as our moral absolution and in fact what we need to do is see that as chapter one celebrate it close it and recognize that we need a chapter two that is all about execution all about the how-to and if you remember one thing from what i want to talk about today it 's that the only way to end poverty to make it history is to build viable systems on the ground that deliver critical and affordable goods and services to the poor in ways that are financially sustainable and scaleable if we do that we really can make poverty history and it was that [UNK] that whole philosophy [UNK] that encouraged me to start my current endeavor called " acumen fund " which is trying to build some mini-blueprints for how we might do that in water health and housing in pakistan india kenya tanzania and egypt and i want to talk a little bit about that and some of the examples so you can see what it is that we 're doing but before i do this [UNK] and this is another one of my pet peeves [UNK] i want to talk a little bit about who the poor are because we too often talk about them as these strong huge masses of people yearning to be free when in fact it 's quite an amazing story on a macro level four billion people on earth make less than four dollars a day that 's who we talk about when we think about " the poor " if you aggregate it it 's the third largest economy on earth and yet most of these people go invisible where we typically work there 's people making between one and three dollars a day who are these people they are farmers and factory workers they work in government offices they 're drivers they are domestics they typically pay for critical goods and services like water like healthcare like housing and they pay 30 to 40 times what their middleclass counterparts pay [UNK] certainly where we work in karachi and nairobi the poor also are willing to make and do make smart decisions if you give them that opportunity so two examples one is in india where there are 240 million farmers most of whom make less than two dollars a day where we work in aurangabad the land is extraordinarily parched you see people on average making 60 cents to a dollar this guy in pink is a social entrepreneur named ami tabar what he did was see what was happening in israel larger approaches and figure out how to do a drip irrigation which is a way of bringing water directly to the plant stock but previously it 's only been created for large-scale farms so ami tabar took this and modularized it down to an eighth of an acre a couple of principles build small make it infinitely expandable and affordable to the poor this family sarita and her husband bought a 15-dollar unit when they were living in a [UNK] literally a three-walled lean-to with a corrugated iron roof after one harvest they had increased their income enough to buy a second system to do their full quarter-acre a couple of years later i meet them they now make four dollars a day which is pretty much middle class for india and they showed me the concrete foundation they had just laid to build their house and i swear you could see the future in that woman 's eyes something i truly believe you ca n't talk about poverty today without talking about malaria bed nets and i again give jeffrey sachs of harvard huge kudos for bringing to the world this notion of his rage [UNK] for five dollars you can save a life malaria is a disease that kills one to three million people a year 300 to 500 million cases are reported it 's estimated that africa loses about 13 billion dollars a year to the disease five dollars can save a life we can send people to the moon we can see if there 's life on mars [UNK] why ca n't we get five-dollar nets to 500 million people the question though is not " why ca n't we " the question is how can we help africans do this for themselves a lot of hurdles one production is too low two price is too high three this is a good road in [UNK] right near where our factory is located distribution is a nightmare but not impossible we started by making a 350,000-dollar loan to the largest traditional bed net manufacturer in africa so that they could transfer technology from japan and build these long-lasting five-year nets here are just some pictures of the factory today three years later the company has employed another thousand women it contributes about 600,000 dollars in wages to the economy of tanzania it 's the largest company in tanzania the throughput rate right now is 1.5 million nets three million by the end of the year we hope to have seven million at the end of next year so the production side is working on the distribution side though as a world we have a lot of work to do right now 95 percent of these nets are being bought by the u.n. and then given primarily to people around africa we 're looking at building on some of the most precious resources of africa people their women and so i want you to meet jacqueline my namesake 21 years old if she were born anywhere else but tanzania i 'm telling you she could run wall street she runs two of the lines and has already saved enough money to put a down payment on her house she makes about two dollars a day is creating an education fund and told me she is not marrying nor having children until these things are completed and so when i told her about our idea [UNK] that maybe we could take a tupperware model from the united states and find a way for the women themselves to go out and sell these nets to others [UNK] she quickly started calculating what she herself could make and signed up we took a lesson from ideo one of our favorite companies and quickly did a prototyping on this and took jacqueline into the area where she lives she brought 10 of the women with whom she interacts together to see if she could sell these nets five dollars apiece despite the fact that people say nobody will buy one and we learned a lot about how you sell things not coming in with our own notions because she did n't even talk about malaria until the very end first she talked about comfort status beauty these nets she said you put them on the floor bugs leave your house children can sleep through the night the house looks beautiful you hang them in the window and we 've started making curtains and not only is it beautiful but people can see status [UNK] that you care about your children only then did she talk about saving your children 's lives a lot of lessons to be learned in terms of how we sell goods and services to the poor i want to end just by saying that there 's enormous opportunity to make poverty history to do it right we have to build business models that matter that are scaleable and that work with africans indians people all over the developing world who fit in this category to do it themselves because at the end of the day it 's about engagement it 's about understanding that people really do n't want handouts that they want to make their own decisions they want to solve their own problems and that by engaging with them not only do we create much more dignity for them but for us as well and so i urge all of you to think next time as to how to engage with this notion and this opportunity that we all have [UNK] to make poverty history [UNK] by really becoming part of the process and moving away from an us-and-them world and realizing that it 's about all of us and the kind of world that we together want to live in and share thank you .the first idea i 'd like to suggest is that we all love music a great deal it means a lot to us but music is even more powerful if you do n't just listen to it but you make it yourself so that 's my first idea and we all know about the mozart effect [UNK] the idea that 's been around for the last five to 10 years [UNK] that just by listening to music or by playing music to your baby [ in utero ] that it 'll raise our iq points 10 20 30 percent great idea but it does n't work at all so you ca n't just listen to music you have to make it somehow and i 'd add to that that it 's not just making it but everybody each of us everybody in the world has the power to create and be part of music in a very dynamic way and that 's one of the main parts of my work so with the mit media lab for quite a while now we 've been engaged in a field called active music what are all the possible ways that we can think of to get everybody in the middle of a musical experience not just listening but making music and we started by making instruments for some of the world 's greatest performers [UNK] we call these hyperinstruments [UNK] for yo-yo ma peter gabriel prince orchestras rock bands instruments where they 're all kinds of sensors built right into the instrument so the instrument knows how it 's being played and just by changing the interpretation and the feeling i can turn my cello into a voice or into a whole orchestra or into something that nobody has ever heard before when we started making these i started thinking why ca n't we make wonderful instruments like that for everybody people who are n't fantastic yo-yo mas or princes so we 've made a whole series of instruments one of the largest collections is called the brain opera it 's a whole orchestra of about 100 instruments all designed for anybody to play using natural skill so you can play a video game drive through a piece of music use your body gesture to control huge masses of sound touch a special surface to make melodies use your voice to make a whole aura and when we make the brain opera we invite the public to come in to try these instruments and then collaborate with us to help make each performance of the brain opera we toured that for a long time it is now permanently in vienna where we built a museum around it and that led to something which you probably do know guitar hero came out of our lab and my two teenage daughters and most of the students at the mit media lab are proof that if you make the right kind of interface people are really interested in being in the middle of a piece of music and playing it over and over and over again so the model works but it 's only the tip of the iceberg because my second idea is that it 's not enough just to want to make music in something like guitar hero and music is very fun but it 's also transformative it 's very very important music can change your life more than almost anything it can change the way you communicate with others it can change your body it can change your mind so we 're trying to go to the next step of how you build on top of something like guitar hero we are very involved in education we have a long-term project called toy symphony where we make all kinds of instruments that are also addictive but for little kids so the kids will fall in love with making music want to spend their time doing it and then will demand to know how it works how to make more how to create so we make squeezy instruments like these music shapers that measure the electricity in your fingers beatbugs that let you tap in rhythms [UNK] they gather your rhythm and like hot potato you send your rhythm to your friends who then have to imitate or respond to what your doing [UNK] and a software package called hyperscore which lets anybody use lines and color to make quite sophisticated music extremely easy to use but once you use it you can go quite deep [UNK] music in any style and then by pressing a button it turns into music notation so that live musicians can play your pieces we 've had good enough really very powerful effects with kids around the world and now people of all ages using hyperscore so we 've gotten more and more interested in using these kinds of creative activities in a much broader context for all kinds of people who do n't usually have the opportunity to make music so one of the growing fields that we 're working on at the media lab right now is music mind and health a lot of you have probably seen oliver sacks ' wonderful new book called " musicophilia " it 's on sale in the bookstore it 's a great book if you have n't seen it it 's worth reading he 's a pianist himself and he details his whole career of looking at and observing incredibly powerful effects that music has had on peoples ' lives in unusual situations so we know for instance that music is almost always the last thing that people with advanced alzheimer 's can still respond to maybe many of you have noticed this with loved ones you can find somebody who ca n't recognize their face in the mirror or ca n't tell anyone in their family but you can still find a shard of music that that person will jump out of the chair and start singing and with that you can bring back parts of people 's memories and personalities music is the best way to restore speech to people who have lost it through strokes movement to people with parkinson 's disease it 's very powerful for depression schizophrenia many many things so we 're working on understanding those underlying principles and then building activities which will let music really improve people 's health and we do this in many ways we work with many different hospitals one of them is right near boston called tewksbury hospital it 's a long-term state hospital where several years ago we started working with hyperscore and patients with physical and mental disabilities this has become a central part of the treatment at tewksbury hospital so everybody there clamors to work on musical activities it 's the activity that seems to accelerate people 's treatment the most and it also brings the entire hospital together as a kind of musical community i wanted to show you a quick video of some of this work before i go on video they 're manipulating each other 's rhythms it 's a real experience not only to learn how to play and listen to rhythms but to train your musical memory and playing music in a group to get their hands on music to shape it themselves change it to experiment with it to make their own music so hyperscore lets you start from scratch very quickly everybody can experience music in a profound way we just have to make different tools the third idea i want to share with you is that music paradoxically i think even more than words is one of the very best ways we have of showing who we really are i love giving talks although strangely i feel more nervous giving talks than playing music if i were here playing cello or playing on a synth or sharing my music with you i 'd be able to show things about myself that i ca n't tell you in words more personal things perhaps deeper things i think that 's true for many of us and i want to give you two examples of how music is one of the most powerful interfaces we have from ourselves to the outside world the first is a really crazy project that we 're building right now called death and the powers and it 's a big opera one of the larger opera projects going on in the world right now and it 's about a man rich successful powerful who wants to live forever so he figures out a way to download himself into his environment actually into a series of books so this guy wants to live forever he downloads himself into his environment the main singer disappears at the beginning of the opera and the entire stage becomes the main character it becomes his legacy and the opera is about what we can share what we can pass on to others to the people we love and what we ca n't every object in the opera comes alive and is a gigantic music instrument like this chandelier it takes up the whole stage it looks like a chandelier but it 's actually a robotic music instrument so as you can see in this prototype gigantic piano strings each string is controlled with a little robotic element [UNK] either little bows that stroke the strings propellers that tickle the strings acoustic signals that vibrate the strings we also have an army of robots on stage these robots are the kind of the intermediary between the main character simon powers and his family there are a whole series of them kind of like a greek chorus they observe the action we 've designed these square robots that we 're testing right now at mit called operabots these operabots follow my music they follow the characters they 're smart enough we hope not to bump into each other they go off on their own and then they can also when you snap line up exactly the way you 'd like to even though they 're cubes they actually have a lot of personality the largest set piece in the opera is called the system it 's a series of books every single book is robotic so they all move they all make sound and when you put them all together they turn into these walls which have the gesture and the personality of simon powers so he 's disappeared but the whole physical environment becomes this person this is how he 's chosen to represent himself the books also have high-packed leds on the spines so it 's all display and here 's the great baritone james maddalena as he enters the system this is a sneak preview this premieres in monaco [UNK] it 's in september 2009 if by any chance you ca n't make it another idea with this project [UNK] here 's this guy building his legacy through this very unusual form through music and through the environment but we 're also making this available both online and in public spaces as a way of each of us to use music and images from our lives to make our own legacy or to make a legacy of someone we love so instead of being grand opera this opera will turn into what we 're thinking of as personal opera and if you 're going to make a personal opera what about a personal instrument everything i 've shown you so far [UNK] whether it 's a hyper-cello for yo-yo ma or squeezy toy for a child [UNK] the instruments stayed the same and are valuable for a certain class of person a virtuoso a child but what if i could make an instrument that could be adapted to the way i personally behave to the way my hands work to what i do very skillfully perhaps to what i do n't do so skillfully i think that this is the future of interface it 's the future of music the future of instruments and i 'd like now to invite two very special people on the stage so that i can give you an example of what personal instruments might be like so can you give a hand to adam boulanger ph.d. student from the mit media lab and dan ellsey dan thanks to ted and to bombardier flexjet dan is here with us today all the way from tewksbury he 's a resident at tewksbury hospital this is by far the farthest he 's strayed from tewksbury hospital i can tell you that because he 's motivated to meet with you today and show you his own music so first of all dan do you want to say hi to everyone and tell everyone who you are dan ellsey hello my name is dan ellsey i am 34 years old and i have cerebral palsy i have always loved music and i am excited to be able to conduct my own music with this new software tod machover and we 're really excited to have you here really dan so we met dan about three years ago three and a half years ago when we started working at tewksbury everybody we met there was fantastic did fantastic music dan had never made music before and it turned out he was really fantastic at it he 's a born composer he 's very shy too so turned out he 's a fantastic composer and over the last few years has been a constant collaborator of ours he has made many many pieces he makes his own cds actually he is quite well known in the boston area [UNK] mentors people at the hospital and children locally in how to make their own music and i 'll let adam tell you so adam is a ph.d. student at mit an expert in music technology and medicine and adam and dan have become close collaborators what adam 's been working on for this last period is not only how to have dan be able easily to make his own pieces but how he can perform his piece using this kind of personal instrument so you want to say a little bit about how you guys work adam boulanger yes so tod and i entered into a discussion following the tewksbury work and it was really about how dan is an expressive person and he 's an intelligent and creative person and it 's in his face it 's in his breathing it 's in his eyes how come he ca n't perform one of his pieces of music that 's our responsibility and it does n't make sense so we started developing a technology that will allow him with nuance with precision with control and despite his physical disability to be able to do that to be able to perform his piece of music so the process and the technology [UNK] basically first we needed an engineering solution so you know we have a firewire camera it looked at an infrared pointer we went with the type of gesture metaphor that dan was already used to with his speaking controller and this was actually the least interesting part of the work you know the design process we needed an input we needed continuous tracking in the software we look at the types of shapes he 's making but then was the really interesting aspect of the work following the engineering part where basically we 're coding over dan 's shoulder at the hospital extensively to figure out you know how does dan move what 's useful to him as an expressive motion you know what 's his metaphor for performance what types of things does he find important to control and convey in a piece of music so all the parameter fitting and really the technology was stretched at that point to fit just dan and you know i think this is a perspective shift it 's not that our technologies [UNK] they provide access they allow us to create pieces of creative work but what about expression what about that moment when an artist delivers that piece of work you know do our technologies allow us to express do they provide structure for us to do that and you know that 's a personal relationship to expression that is lacking in the technological sphere so you know with dan we needed a new design process a new engineering process to sort of discover his movement and his path to expression that allow him to perform and so that 's what we 'll do today tm so let 's do it so dan do you want to tell everyone about what you 're going to play now de this is " my eagle song " tm so dan is going to play a piece of his called " my eagle song " in fact this is the score for dan 's piece completely composed by dan in hyperscore so he can use his infrared tracker to go directly into hyperscore he 's incredibly fast at it too faster than i am in fact tm he 's really modest too so he can go in hyperscore you start out by making melodies and rhythms he can place those exactly where he wants each one gets a color he goes back into the composition window draws the lines places everything the way he wants to looking at the hyperscore you can see it also you can see where the sections are something might continue for a while change get really crazy and then end up with a big bang at the end so that 's the way he made his piece and as adam says we then figured out the best way to have him perform his piece it 's going to be looked at by this camera analyze his movements it 's going to let dan bring out all the different aspects of his music that he wants to and you 're also going to notice a visual on the screen we asked one of our students to look at what the camera is measuring but instead of making it very literal showing you exactly the camera tracing we turned it into a graphic that shows you the basic movement and shows the way it 's being analyzed i think it gives an understanding of how we 're picking out movement from what dan 's doing but i think it will also show you if you look at that movement that when dan makes music his motions are very purposeful very precise very disciplined and they 're also very beautiful so in hearing this piece as i mentioned before the most important thing is the music 's great and it 'll show you who dan is so are we ready adam ab yeah tm ok now dan will play his piece " my eagle song " for you tm bravo .hello everyone and so the two of us are here to give you an example of creation and i 'm going to be folding one of robert lang 's models and this is the piece of paper it will be made from and you can see all of the folds that are needed for it and rufus is going to be doing some improvisation on his custom five-string electric cello and it 's very exciting to listen to him are you ready to go ok just to make it a little bit more exciting all right take it away rufus all right there you go .as a child i was raised by native hawaiian elders [UNK] three old women who took care of me while my parents worked the year is 1963 we 're at the ocean it 's twilight we 're watching the rising of the stars and the shifting of the tides it 's a stretch of beach we know so well the smooth stones on the sand are familiar to us if you saw these women on the street in their faded clothes you might dismiss them as poor and simple that would be a mistake these women are descendants of polynesian navigators trained in the old ways by their elders and now they 're passing it on to me they teach me the names of the winds and the rains of astronomy according to a genealogy of stars there 's a new moon on the horizon hawaiians say it 's a good night for fishing they begin to chant [ hawaiian chant ] when they finish they sit in a circle and ask me to come to join them they want to teach me about my destiny i thought every seven-year-old went through this " baby girl someday the world will be in trouble people will forget their wisdom it will take elders ' voices from the far corners of the world to call the world into balance you will go far away it will sometimes be a lonely road we will not be there but you will look into the eyes of seeming strangers and you will recognize your ohana your family and it will take all of you it will take all of you " these words i hold onto all my life because the idea of doing it alone terrifies me the year is 2007 i 'm on a remote island in micronesia satawal is one half-mile long by one mile wide it 's the home of my mentor his name is pius mau piailug mau is a palu a navigator priest he 's also considered the greatest wave finder in the world there are fewer than a handful of palu left on this island their tradition is so extraordinary that these mariners sailed three million square miles across the pacific without the use of instruments they could synthesize patterns in nature using the rising and setting of stars the sequence and direction of waves the flight patterns of certain birds even the slightest hint of color on the underbelly of a cloud would inform them and help them navigate with the keenest accuracy when western scientists would join mau on the canoe and watch him go into the hull it appeared that an old man was going to rest in fact the hull of the canoe is the womb of the vessel it is the most accurate place to feel the rhythm and sequence and direction of waves mau was in fact gathering explicit data using his entire body it 's what he had been trained to do since he was five years old now science may dismiss this methodology but polynesian navigators use it today because it provides them an accurate determination of the angle and direction of their vessel the palu also had an uncanny ability to forecast weather conditions days in advance sometimes i 'd be with mau on a cloud-covered night and we 'd sit at the easternmost coast of the island and he would look out and then he would say " okay we go " he saw that first glint of light [UNK] he knew what the weather was going to be three days from now their achievements intellectually and scientifically are extraordinary and they are so relevant for these times that we are in when we are riding out storms we are in such a critical moment of our collective history they have been compared to astronauts [UNK] these elder navigators who sail vast open oceans in double-hulled canoes thousands of miles from a small island their canoes our rockets their sea our space the wisdom of these elders is not a mere collection of stories about old people in some remote spot this is part of our collective narrative it 's humanity 's dna we can not afford to lose it the year is 2010 just as the women in hawaii that raised me predicted the world is in trouble we live in a society bloated with data yet starved for wisdom we 're connected 247 yet anxiety fear depression and loneliness is at an all-time high we must course-correct an african shaman said " your society worships the jester while the king stands in plain clothes " the link between the past and the future is fragile this i know intimately because even as i travel throughout the world to listen to these stories and record them i struggle i am haunted by the fact that i no longer remember the names of the winds and the rains mau passed away five months ago but his legacy and lessons live on and i am reminded that throughout the world there are cultures with vast sums of knowledge in them as potent as the micronesian navigators that are going dismissed that this is a testament to brilliant brilliant technology and science and wisdom that is vanishing rapidly because when an elder dies a library is burned and throughout the world libraries are ablaze i am grateful for the fact that i had a mentor like mau who taught me how to navigate and i realize through a lesson that he shared that we continue to find our way and this is what he said " the island is the canoe the canoe the island " and what he meant was if you are voyaging and far from home your very survival depends on everyone aboard you can not make the voyage alone you were never meant to this whole notion of every man for himself is completely unsustainable it always was so in closing i would offer you this the planet is our canoe and we are the voyagers true navigation begins in the human heart it 's the most important map of all together may we journey well .this is about a place in london called kiteflyer 's hill where i used to go and spend hours going " when is he coming back when is he coming back " so this is another one dedicated to that guy 1 who i 've got over but this is " kiteflyer 's hill " it 's a beautiful song written by a guy called martin evan actually for me boo hewerdine thomas dolby thank you very much for inviting me it 's been a blessing singing for you thank you very much do you remember when we used to go up to kiteflyer 's hill those summer nights so still with all of the city beneath us and all of our lives ahead before cruel and foolish words were cruelly and foolishly said some nights i think of you and then i go up on kiteflyer 's hill wrapped up against the winter chill and somewhere in the city beneath me you lie asleep in your bed and i wonder if ever just briefly do i creep in your dreams now and then where are you now my wild summer love where are you now have the years been kind and do you think of me sometimes up on kiteflyer 's hill oh i pray you one day will we wo n't say a word we wo n't need them sometimes silence is best we 'll just stand in the still of the evening and whisper farewell to loneliness where are you now my wild summer love where are you now do you think of me sometimes and do you ever make that climb where are you now my wild summer love where are you now have the years been kind and do you ever make that climb up on kiteflyer 's hill kiteflyer 's 1 [ french ] where are you where are you now where are you now kiteflyer 's 1 gracias thank you very much .do you worry about what is going to kill you heart disease cancer a car accident most of us worry about things we ca n't control like war terrorism the tragic earthquake that just occurred in haiti but what really threatens humanity a few years ago professor vaclav smil tried to calculate the probability of sudden disasters large enough to change history he called these " massively fatal discontinuities " meaning that they could kill up to 100 million people in the next 50 years he looked at the odds of another world war of a massive volcanic eruption even of an asteroid hitting the earth but he placed the likelihood of one such event above all others at close to 100 percent and that is a severe flu pandemic now you might think of flu as just a really bad cold but it can be a death sentence every year 36,000 people in the united states die of seasonal flu in the developing world the data is much sketchier but the death toll is almost certainly higher you know the problem is if this virus occasionally mutates so dramatically it essentially is a new virus and then we get a pandemic in 1918 a new virus appeared that killed some 50 to 100 million people it spread like wildfire and some died within hours of developing symptoms are we safer today well we seem to have dodged the deadly pandemic this year that most of us feared but this threat could reappear at any time the good news is that we 're at a moment in time when science technology globalization is converging to create an unprecedented possibility the possibility to make history by preventing infectious diseases that still account for one-fifth of all deaths and countless misery on earth we can do this we 're already preventing millions of deaths with existing vaccines and if we get these to more people we can certainly save more lives but with new or better vaccines for malaria tb hiv pneumonia diarrhea flu we could end suffering that has been on the earth since the beginning of time so i 'm here to trumpet vaccines for you but first i have to explain why they 're important because vaccines the power of them is really like a whisper when they work they can make history but after a while you can barely hear them now some of us are old enough to have a small circular scar on our arms from an inoculation we received as children but when was the last time you worried about smallpox a disease that killed half a billion people last century and no longer is with us or polio how many of you remember the iron lung we do n't see scenes like this anymore because of vaccines now it 's interesting because there are 30-odd diseases that can be treated with vaccines now but we 're still threatened by things like hiv and flu why is that well here 's the dirty little secret until recently we have n't had to know exactly how a vaccine worked we knew they worked through old-fashioned trial and error you took a pathogen you modified it you injected it into a person or an animal and you saw what happened this worked well for most pathogens somewhat well for crafty bugs like flu but not at all for hiv for which humans have no natural immunity so let 's explore how vaccines work they basically create a cache of weapons for your immune system which you can deploy when needed now when you get a viral infection what normally happens is it takes days or weeks for your body to fight back at full strength and that might be too late when you 're pre-immunized what happens is you have forces in your body pre-trained to recognize and defeat specific foes so that 's really how vaccines work now let 's take a look at a video that we 're debuting at ted for the first time on how an effective hiv vaccine might work narrator a vaccine trains the body in advance how to recognize and neutralize a specific invader after hiv penetrates the body 's mucosal barriers it infects immune cells to replicate the invader draws the attention of the immune system 's front-line troops dendritic cells or macrophages capture the virus and display pieces of it memory cells generated by the hiv vaccine are activated when they learn hiv is present from the front-line troops these memory cells immediately deploy the exact weapons needed memory b cells turn into plasma cells which produce wave after wave of the specific antibodies that latch onto hiv to prevent it from infecting cells while squadrons of killer t cells seek out and destroy cells that are already hiv infected the virus is defeated without a vaccine these responses would have taken more than a week by that time the battle against hiv would already have been lost seth berkley really cool video is n't it the antibodies you just saw in this video in action are the ones that make most vaccines work so the real question then is how do we ensure that your body makes the exact ones that we need to protect against flu and hiv the principal challenge for both of these viruses is that they 're always changing so let 's take a look at the flu virus in this rendering of the flu virus these different colored spikes are what it uses to infect you and also what the antibodies use is a handle to essentially grab and neutralize the virus when these mutate they change their shape and the antibodies do n't know what they 're looking at anymore so that 's why every year you can catch a slightly different strain of flu it 's also why in the spring we have to make a best guess at which three strains are going to prevail the next year put those into a single vaccine and rush those into production for the fall even worse the most common influenza [UNK] influenza a [UNK] also infects animals that live in close proximity to humans and they can recombine in those particular animals in addition wild aquatic birds carry all known strains of influenza so you 've got this situation in 2003 we had an h5n1 virus that jumped from birds into humans in a few isolated cases with an apparent mortality rate of 70 percent now luckily that particular virus although very scary at the time did not transmit from person to person very easily this year 's h1n1 threat was actually a human avian swine mixture that arose in mexico it was easily transmitted but luckily was pretty mild and so in a sense our luck is holding out but you know another wild bird could fly over at anytime now let 's take a look at hiv as variable as flu is hiv makes flu look like the rock of gibraltar the virus that causes aids is the trickiest pathogen scientists have ever confronted it mutates furiously it has decoys to evade the immune system it attacks the very cells that are trying to fight it and it quickly hides itself in your genome here 's a slide looking at the genetic variation of flu and comparing that to hiv a much wilder target in the video a moment ago you saw fleets of new viruses launching from infected cells now realize that in a recently infected person there are millions of these ships each one is just slightly different finding a weapon that recognizes and sinks all of them makes the job that much harder now in the 27 years since hiv was identified as the cause of aids we 've developed more drugs to treat hiv than all other viruses put together these drugs are n't cures but they represent a huge triumph of science because they take away the automatic death sentence from a diagnosis of hiv at least for those who can access them the vaccine effort though is really quite different large companies moved away from it because they thought the science was so difficult and vaccines were seen as poor business many thought that it was just impossible to make an aids vaccine but today evidence tells us otherwise in september we had surprising but exciting findings from a clinical trial that took place in thailand for the first time we saw an aids vaccine work in humans [UNK] albeit quite modestly [UNK] and that particular vaccine was made almost a decade ago newer concepts and early testing now show even greater promise in the best of our animal models but in the past few months researchers have also isolated several new broadly neutralizing antibodies from the blood of an hiv infected individual now what does this mean we saw earlier that hiv is highly variable that a broad neutralizing antibody latches on and disables multiple variations of the virus if you take these and you put them in the best of our monkey models they provide full protection from infection in addition these researchers found a new site on hiv where the antibodies can grab onto and what 's so special about this spot is that it changes very little as the virus mutates it 's like as many times as the virus changes its clothes it 's still wearing the same socks and now our job is to make sure we get the body to really hate those socks so what we 've got is a situation the thai results tell us we can make an aids vaccine and the antibody findings tell us how we might do that this strategy working backwards from an antibody to create a vaccine candidate has never been done before in vaccine research it 's called retro-vaccinology and its implications extend way beyond that of just hiv so think of it this way we 've got these new antibodies we 've identified and we know that they latch onto many many variations of the virus we know that they have to latch onto a specific part so if we can figure out the precise structure of that part present that through a vaccine what we hope is we can prompt your immune system to make these matching antibodies and that would create a universal hiv vaccine now it sounds easier than it is because the structure actually looks more like this blue antibody diagram attached to its yellow binding site and as you can imagine these three-dimensional structures are much harder to work on and if you guys have ideas to help us solve this we 'd love to hear about it but you know the research that has occurred from hiv now has really helped with innovation with other diseases so for instance a biotechnology company has now found broadly neutralizing antibodies to influenza as well as a new antibody target on the flu virus they 're currently making a cocktail [UNK] an antibody cocktail [UNK] that can be used to treat severe overwhelming cases of flu in the longer term what they can do is use these tools of retro-vaccinology to make a preventive flu vaccine now retro-vaccinology is just one technique within the ambit of so-called rational vaccine design let me give you another example we talked about before the h and n spikes on the surface of the flu virus notice these other smaller protuberances these are largely hidden from the immune system now it turns out that these spots also do n't change much when the virus mutates if you can cripple these with specific antibodies you could cripple all versions of the flu so far animal tests indicate that such a vaccine could prevent severe disease although you might get a mild case so if this works in humans what we 're talking about is a universal flu vaccine one that does n't need to change every year and would remove the threat of death we really could think of flu then as just a bad cold of course the best vaccine imaginable is only valuable to the extent we get it to everyone who needs it so to do that we have to combine smart vaccine design with smart production methods and of course smart delivery methods so i want you to think back a few months ago in june the world health organization declared the first global flu pandemic in 41 years the u.s. government promised 150 million doses of vaccine by october 15th for the flu peak vaccines were promised to developing countries hundreds of millions of dollars were spent and flowed to accelerating vaccine manufacturing so what happened well we first figured out how to make flu vaccines how to produce them in the early 1940s it was a slow cumbersome process that depended on chicken eggs millions of living chicken eggs viruses only grow in living things and so it turned out that for flu chicken eggs worked really well for most strains you could get one to two doses of vaccine per egg luckily for us we live in an era of breathtaking biomedical advances so today we get our flu vaccines from 1 chicken eggs hundreds of millions of chicken eggs almost nothing has changed the system is reliable but the problem is you never know how well a strain is going to grow this year 's swine flu strain grew very poorly in early production basically .6 doses per egg so here 's an alarming thought what if that wild bird flies by again you could see an avian strain that would infect the poultry flocks and then we would have no eggs for our vaccines so dan [ barber ] if you want billions of chicken pellets for your fish farm i know where to get them so right now the world can produce about 350 million doses of flu vaccine for the three strains and we can up that to about 1.2 billion doses if we want to target a single variant like swine flu but this assumes that our factories are humming because in 2004 the u.s. supply was cut in half by contamination at one single plant and the process still takes more than half a year so are we better prepared than we were in 1918 well with the new technologies emerging now i hope we can say definitively " yes " imagine we could produce enough flu vaccine for everyone in the entire world for less than half of what we 're currently spending now in the united states with a range of new technologies we could here 's an example a company i 'm engaged with has found a specific piece of the h spike of flu that sparks the immune system if you lop this off and attach it to the tail of a different bacterium which creates a vigorous immune response they 've created a very powerful flu fighter this vaccine is so small it can be grown in a common bacteria e. coli now as you know bacteria reproduce quickly [UNK] it 's like making yogurt [UNK] and so we could produce enough swine origin flu for the entire world in a few factories in a few weeks with no eggs for a fraction of the cost of current methods so here 's a comparison of several of these new vaccine technologies and aside from the radically increased production and huge cost savings [UNK] for example the e. coli method i just talked about [UNK] look at the time saved this would be lives saved the developing world mostly left out of the current response sees the potential of these alternate technologies and they 're leapfrogging the west india mexico and others are already making experimental flu vaccines and they may be the first place we see these vaccines in use because these technologies are so efficient and relatively cheap billions of people can have access to lifesaving vaccines if we can figure out how to deliver them now think of where this leads us new infectious diseases appear or reappear every few years some day perhaps soon we 'll have a virus that is going to threaten all of us will we be quick enough to react before millions die luckily this year 's flu was relatively mild i say " luckily " in part because virtually no one in the developing world was vaccinated so if we have the political and financial foresight to sustain our investments we will master these and new tools of vaccinology and with these tools we can produce enough vaccine for everyone at low cost and ensure healthy productive lives no longer must flu have to kill half a million people a year no longer does aids need to kill two million a year no longer do the poor and vulnerable need to be threatened by infectious diseases or indeed anybody instead of having vaclav smil 's " massively fatal discontinuity " of life we can ensure the continuity of life what the world needs now are these new vaccines and we can make it happen thank you very much chris anderson thank you thank you so the science is changing in your mind seth [UNK] i mean you must dream about this [UNK] what is the kind of time scale on let 's start with hiv for a game-changing vaccine that 's actually out there and usable sb the game change can come at any time because the problem we have now is we 've shown we can get a vaccine to work in humans we just need a better one and with these types of antibodies we know humans can make them so if we can figure out how to do that then we have the vaccine and what 's interesting is there already is some evidence that we 're beginning to crack that problem so the challenge is full speed ahead ca in your gut do you think it 's probably going to be at least another five years sb you know everybody says it 's 10 years but it 's been 10 years every 10 years so i hate to put a timeline on scientific innovation but the investments that have occurred are now paying dividends ca and that 's the same with universal flu vaccine the same kind of thing sb i think flu is different i think what happened with flu is we 've got a bunch [UNK] i just showed some of this [UNK] a bunch of really cool and useful technologies that are ready to go now they look good the problem has been that what we did is we invested in traditional technologies because that 's what we were comfortable with you also can use adjuvants which are chemicals you mix that 's what europe is doing so we could have diluted out our supply of flu and made more available but going back to what michael specter said the anti-vaccine crowd did n't really want that to happen ca and malaria 's even further behind sb no malaria there is a candidate that actually showed efficacy in an earlier trial and is currently in phase three trials now it probably is n't the perfect vaccine but it 's moving along ca seth most of us do work where every month we produce something we get that kind of gratification you 've been slaving away at this for more than a decade and i salute you and your colleagues for what you do the world needs people like you thank you sb thank you .good morning happy to see so many fine folks out here and so many smiling faces i have a very peculiar background attitude and approach to the real world because i am a conjurer now i prefer that term over magician because if i were a magician that would mean that i use spells and incantations and weird gestures in order to accomplish real magic no i do n't do that i 'm a conjurer who is someone who pretends to be a real magician now how do we go about that sort of thing we depend on the fact that audiences such as yourselves will make assumptions for example when i walked up here and i took the microphone from the stand and switched it on you assumed this was a microphone which it is not as a matter of fact this is something that about half of you more than half of you will not be familiar with it 's a beard trimmer you see and it makes a very bad microphone i 've tried it many times the other assumption that you made [UNK] and this little lesson is to show you that you will make assumptions not only that you can but that you will when they are properly suggested to you you believe i 'm looking at you wrong i 'm not looking at you i ca n't see you i know you 're out there they told me backstage it 's a full house and such i know you 're there because i can hear you but i ca n't see you because i normally wear glasses these are not glasses these are empty frames quite empty frames now why would a grown man appear before you wearing empty frames on his face to fool you ladies and gentlemen to deceive you to show that you too can make assumptions do n't you ever forget that now i have to do something [UNK] first of all switch to real glasses so i can actually see you which would probably be a convenience i do n't know i have n't had a good look well it 's not that great a convenience i have to do something now which seems a little bit strange for a magician but i 'm going to take some medication this is a full bottle of calms forte i 'll explain that in just a moment ignore the instructions that 's what the government has to put in there to confuse you i 'm sure i will take enough of these mm indeed the whole container thirty-two tablets of calms forte now that i 've done that [UNK] i 'll explain it in a moment [UNK] i must tell you that i am an actor i 'm an actor who plays a specific part i play the part of a magician a wizard if you will a real wizard if someone were to appear on this stage in front of me and actually claim to be an ancient prince of denmark named hamlet you would be insulted and rightly so why would a man assume that you would believe something bizarre like this but there exists out there a very large population of people who will tell you that they have psychic magical powers that they can predict the future that they can make contact with the deceased oh they also say they will sell you astrology or other fortunetelling methods oh they gladly sell you that yes and they also say that they can give you perpetual motion machines and free energy systems they claim to be psychics or sensitives whatever they can but the one thing that has made a big comeback just recently is this business of speaking with the dead now to my innocent mind dead implies incapable of communicating you might agree with me on that but these people they tend to tell you that not only can they communicate with the dead [UNK] " hi there " [UNK] but they can hear the dead as well and they can relay this information back to the living i wonder if that 's true i do n't think so because this subculture of people use exactly the same gimmicks that we magicians do exactly the same [UNK] the same physical methods the same psychological methods [UNK] and they effectively and profoundly deceive millions of people around the earth to their detriment they deceive these people costs them a lot of money cost them a lot of emotional anguish billions of dollars are spent every year all over the globe on these charlatans now i have two questions i would like to ask these people if i had the opportunity to do so first question if i want to ask them to call up [UNK] because they do hear them through the ear they listen to the spirits like this [UNK] i 'm going to ask you to call up the ghost of my grandmother because when she died she had the family will and she secreted it someplace we do n't know where it is so we ask granny " where is the will granny " what does granny say she says " i 'm in heaven and it 's wonderful i 'm here with all my old friends my deceased friends and my family and all the puppy dogs and the kittens that i used to have when i was a little girl and i love you and i 'll always be with you good bye " and she did n't answer the damn question 1 where is the will now she could easily have said " oh it 's in the library on the second shelf behind the encyclopedia " but she does n't say that no she does n't she does n't bring any useful information to us we paid a lot of money for that information be we did n't get it the second question that i 'd like to ask rather simple suppose i ask them to contact the spirit of my deceased father-in-law as an example why do they insist on saying [UNK] remember they speak into this ear [UNK] why do they say " my name starts with j or m " is this a hunting game hunting and fishing what is it is it 20 questions no it 's more like 120 questions but it is a cruel vicious absolutely conscienceless [UNK] i 'll be all right keep your seats [UNK] game that these people play and they take advantage of the innocent the naive the grieving the needy people out there now this is a process that is called cold reading there 's one fellow out there van praagh is his name james van praagh he 's one of the big practitioners of this sort of thing john edward sylvia browne and rosemary altea they are other operators there are hundreds of them all over the earth but in this country james van praagh is very big and what does he do he likes to tell you how the deceased got deceased the people he 's talking to through his ear you see so what he says is very often is like this he says " he tells me he tells me before he passed that he had trouble breathing " folks that 's what dying is all about 1 you stop breathing and then you 're dead it 's that simple and that 's the kind of information they 're going to bring back to you i do n't think so now these people will make guesses they 'll say things like " why am i getting electricity he 's saying to me 'electricity ' was he an electrician " " no " " did he ever have an electric razor " " no " it was a game of hunting questions like this this is what they go through now folks often ask us at the james randi educational foundation they call me they say " why are you so concerned about this mr. randi is n't it just a lot of fun " no it is not fun it is a cruel farce now it may bring a certain amount of comfort but that comfort lasts only about 20 minutes or so and then the people look in the mirror and they say i just paid a lot of money for that reading and what did she say to me 'i love you 1 ' " they always say that they do n't get any information they do n't get any value for what they spend now sylvia browne is the big operator we call her " the talons " sylvia browne [UNK] thank you [UNK] sylvia browne is the big operator in this field at this very moment now sylvia browne [UNK] just to show you [UNK] she actually gets 700 dollars for a 20 minute reading over the telephone she does n't even go there in person and you have to wait up to two years because she 's booked ahead that amount of time you pay by credit card or whatever and then she will call you sometime in the next two years you can tell it 's her " hello this is sylvia browne " that 's her you can tell right away now montel williams is an intelligent man we all know who he is on television he 's well educated he 's smart he knows what sylvia browne is doing but he does n't give a damn he just does n't care because the bottom line is the sponsors love it and he will expose her to television publicity all the time now what does sylvia browne give you for that 700 dollars she gives you the names of your guardian angels that 's first now without that how could we possibly function she gives you the names of previous lives who you were in previous lives duh it turns out that the women that she gives readings for were all babylonian princesses or something like that and the men were all grecian warriors fighting with agamemnon nothing is ever said about a 14 year-old bootblack in the streets of london who died of consumption he is n't worth bringing back obviously and the strange thing [UNK] folks you may have noticed this too you see these folks on television [UNK] they never call anybody back from hell everyone comes back from heaven but never from hell if they call back any of my friends they 're not going to 1 well you see the story now sylvia browne is an exception an exception in one way because the james randi educational foundation my foundation offers a one million dollar prize in negotiable bonds very simply won all you have to do is prove any paranormal occult or supernatural event or power of any kind under proper observing conditions it 's very easy win the million dollars sylvia browne is an exception in that she 's the only professional psychic in the whole world that has accepted our challenge she did this on the " larry king live " show on cnn six and a half years ago and we have n't heard from her since strange she said that first of all that she did n't know how to contact me duh a professional psychic who speaks to dead people she ca n't reach me i 'm alive you may have noticed well pretty well anyway she could n't reach me now she says she does n't want to reach me because i 'm a godless person all the more reason to take the million dollars would n't you think sylvia now these people need to be stopped seriously now they need to be stopped because this is a cruel farce we get people coming to the foundation all the time they 're ruined financially and emotionally because they 've given their money and their faith to these people now i popped some pills earlier i have to explain that to you homeopathy let 's find out what that 's all about hmm you 've heard of it it 's an alternative form of healing right homeopathy actually consists [UNK] and that 's what this is this is calms forte 32 caplets of sleeping pills 1 i forgot to tell you that i just ingested six and a half days worth of sleeping pills six and a half days that certainly is a fatal dose it says right on the back here " in case of overdose contact your poison control center immediately " and it gives an 800 number keep your seats [UNK] it 's going to be okay i do n't really need it because i 've been doing this stunt for audiences all over the world for the last eight or 10 years taking fatal doses of homeopathic sleeping pills why do n't they affect me the answer may surprise you what is homeopathy it 's taking a medicine that really works and diluting it down well beyond avogadro 's limit diluting it down to the point where there 's none of it left now folks this is not just a metaphor i 'm going to give you now it 's true it 's exactly equivalent to taking one 325 milligram aspirin tablet throwing it into the middle of lake tahoe and then stirring it up obviously with a very big stick and waiting two years or so until the solution is homogeneous then when you get a headache you take a sip of this water and [UNK] voila 1 [UNK] it is gone now that is true that is what homeopathy is all about and another claim that they make [UNK] you 'll love this one [UNK] the more dilute the medicine is they say the more powerful it is now wait a minute we heard about a guy in florida the poor man he was on homeopathic medicine he died of an overdose he forgot to take his pill it 's a ridiculous thing it is absolutely ridiculous i do n't know what we 're doing believing in all this nonsense over all these years now let me tell you the james randi educational foundation is waving this very big carrot but i must say the fact that nobody has taken us up on this offer does n't mean that the powers do n't exist they might some place out there maybe these people are just independently wealthy well with sylvia browne i would think so you know 700 dollars for a 20 minute reading over the telephone [UNK] that 's more than lawyers make 1 i mean that 's a fabulous amount of money these people do n't need the million dollars perhaps but would n't you think they 'd like to take it just to make me look silly just to get rid of this godless person out there that sylvia browne talks about all the time i think that something needs to be done about this we really would love to have suggestions from you folks on how to contact federal state and local authorities to get them to do something if you find out [UNK] now i understand we 've seen people even today speaking to us about aids epidemics and starving kids around the world and impure water supplies that people have to suffer with those are very important critically important to us and we must do something about those problems but at the same time as arthur c. clarke said the rotting of the human mind the business of believing in the paranormal and the occult and the supernatural [UNK] all of this total nonsense this medieval thinking [UNK] i think something should be done about that and it all lies in education largely it 's the media who are to blame for this sort of thing they shamelessly promote all kinds of nonsense of this sort because it pleases the sponsors it 's the bottom line the dollar line that 's what they 're looking at we really must do something about this i 'm willing to take your suggestions and i 'm willing to have you tune in to our webpage it 's www.randi.org go in there and look at the archives and you will begin to understand much more of what i 've been talking about today you will see the records that we have there 's nothing like sitting in that library and having a family appear there and say that mum gave away all the family fortune she cashed in the cds she gave away the stocks and the certificates that 's really sad to hear and it has n't helped them one bit has n't solved any of their problems yes there could be a rotting of the american mind and of the minds all the way around the earth if we do n't start to think sensibly about these things now we 've offered this carrot as i say we 've dangled the carrot we 're waiting for the psychics to come forth and snap at it oh we get lots of them hundreds of them every year come by these are dowsers and people who think that they can talk to the dead as well but they 're amateurs they do n't know how to evaluate their own so-called powers the professionals never come near us except in that case of sylvia browne that i told you about a moment ago she did accept and then backed away ladies and gentlemen i 'm james randi and i 'm waiting thank you .many of you could ask the question you know why is a flying car or maybe more accurately a roadable aircraft possible at this time a number of years ago mr. ford predicted that flying cars of some form would be available now 60 years later i 'm here to tell you why it 's possible when i was about five years old not very much [UNK] about a year after mr. ford made his predictions i was living in a rural part of canada on the side of a mountain in a very isolated area getting to school for a kid that was actually pretty short for his age through the canadian winter was not a pleasant experience it was a trying and scary thing for a young kid to be going through at the end of my first year in school in the summer of that year i discovered a couple hummingbirds that were caught in a shed near my home they 'd worn themselves out beating themselves against the window and well they were easy to capture i took them outside and as i let them go that split second even though they were very tired that second i let them go they hovered for a second then zipped off into the distance i thought what a great way to get to school for a kid at that age this was like infinite speed disappearing and i was very inspired by that and so the next [UNK] over the next six decades believe it or not i 've built a number of aircraft with the goal of creating something that could do for you or me what the hummingbird does and give you that flexibility i 've called this vehicle generically a volantor after the latin word " volant " meaning to fly in a light nimble manner volantor-like helicopter perhaps the faa the controlling body above all calls it a " powered lift aircraft " and they 've actually issued a pilot 's license [UNK] a powerlift pilot 's license [UNK] for this type of aircraft it 's closer than you think it 's kind of remarkable when you consider that there are no operational powered lift aircraft so for once perhaps the government is ahead of itself the press calls my particular volantor a " skycar " this is a little bit earlier version of it that 's why it 's given the x designation but it 's a four-passenger aircraft that could take off vertically like a helicopter [UNK] therefore it does n't need an airfield on the ground it 's powered electrically it 's actually classified as a motorcycle because of the three wheels which is a great asset because it allows you theoretically to use this on the highways in most states and actually in all cities so that 's an asset because if you 've got to deal with the crash protection issues of the automobile forget it [UNK] you 're never going to fly it one could say that a helicopter does pretty much what the hummingbird does and gets around in much the same way and it 's true but a helicopter is a very complex device it 's expensive [UNK] so expensive that very few people could own or use it it 's often been described because of its fragile nature and its complexity as a series of parts [UNK] a large number of parts [UNK] flying in formation another difference and i have to describe this because it 's very personal another great difference between the helicopter and the volantor [UNK] in my case the skycar volantor [UNK] is the experience that i 've had in flying both of those in a helicopter you feel [UNK] and it 's still a remarkable sensation [UNK] you feel like you 're being hauled up from above by a vibrating crane when you get in the skycar [UNK] and i can tell you there 's only one other person that 's flown it but he had the same sensation [UNK] you really feel like you 're being lifted up by a magic carpet without any vibration whatsoever the sensation is unbelievable and it 's been a great motivator i only get to fly this vehicle occasionally and only when i can persuade my stockholders to let me do so but it 's still one of those wonderful experiences that reward you for all that time what we really need is something to replace the automobile for those 50-plus mile trips very few people realize that 50 mile-plus trips make up 85 percent of the miles traveled in america if we can get rid of that then the highways will now be useful to you as contrasted by what 's happening in many parts of the world today on this next slide is an interesting history of what we really have seen in infrastructure because whether i give you a perfect skycar the perfect vehicle for use it 's going to have very little value to you unless you 've got a system to use it in i 'm sure any of you have asked the question yeah are there great things up there [UNK] what am i going to do get up there it 's bad enough on a highway what 's it going to be like to be in the air this world that you 're going to be talking about tomorrow is going to be completely integrated you 're not going to be a pilot you 're going to be a passenger and it 's the infrastructure that really determines whether this process goes forward i can tell you technically we can build skycars [UNK] my god we went to the moon 1 the technology there was much more difficult than what i 'm dealing with here but we have to have these priority changes we have to have infrastructure to go with this historically you see that we got around 200 years ago by canals and as that system disappeared were replaced by railroads as that disappeared we came in with highways but if you look at that top corner [UNK] the highway system [UNK] you see where we are today highways are no longer being built and that 's a fact you wo n't see any additional highways in the next 10 years however the next 10 years if like the last 10 years we 're going to see 30 percent more traffic and where is that going to lead you to so the issue then i 've often asked is when is it going to happen when are we going to be able to have these vehicles and of course if you ask me i 'm going to give you a really optimistic view after all i 've been spending 60 years here believing it 's going to happen tomorrow so i 'm not going to quote myself on this i 'd prefer to quote someone else who testified with me before congress and in his position as head of nasa put forward this particular vision of the future of this type of aircraft now i would argue actually if you look at the fact that on the highways today you 're only averaging about 30 miles per hour [UNK] on average according to the dot [UNK] the skycar travels at over 300 miles an hour up to 25,000 feet and so in effect you could see perhaps a tenfold increase in the ability to get around as far as speed is concerned unbeknownst to many of you the highway in the sky that i 'm talking about here has been under construction for 10 years it makes use of the gps [UNK] you 're familiar with gps in your automobile but you may not be familiar with the fact that there 's a gps u.s. there 's a russian gps and there 's a new gps system going to europe called galileo with those three systems you have what is always necessary [UNK] a level of redundancy that says if one system fails you 'll still have a way to make sure that you 're being controlled because if you 're in this world where computers are controlling what you 're doing it 's going to be very critical that something ca n't fail on you how would a trip in a skycar work well you ca n't right now take off from your home because it 's too noisy i mean to be able to take off from your home you 'd have to be extremely quiet but it 's still fairly quiet you 'd motor electrically to a vertiport which may be a few blocks maybe even a few miles away this is clearly as i said earlier a roadable aircraft and you 're not going to spend that much time on the road after all if you can fly like that why are you going to drive around on a highway go to a local vertiport plug in your destination delivered almost like a passenger you can play computer games you can sleep you can read on the way this is the world [UNK] there wo n't be you as a pilot and i know the pilots in the audience are n't going to like that [UNK] and i 've had a lot of bad feedback from people who want to be up there flying around and experiencing that and of course i suppose like recreational parks you can still do that but the vehicle itself is going to be a very very controlled environment or it 's going to have no use to you as a person who might use such a system we flew the first vehicle for the international press in 1965 when i really got it started i was a professor at the u.c davis system and i got a lot of excitement around this and i was able to fund the initiation of the program back in that time and then through the various years we invented various vehicles actually the critical point was in 1989 when we demonstrated the stability of this vehicle [UNK] how completely stable it was in all circumstances which is of course very critical still not a practical vehicle during all of this but moving in the right direction we believe finally in the early part of [UNK] or actually the middle of 2002 we flew the 400 [UNK] m400 which was the four-passenger vehicle in this case here we 're flying it remotely as we always did at the beginning and we had very small power plants in it at this time we are now installing larger powerplants which will make it possible for me to get back on board a vertical-takeoff aircraft is not the safest vehicle during the test flight program there 's an old adage that applied for the years between 1950s and 1970s when every aeronautical company was working on vertical-takeoff aircraft a vertical-takeoff aircraft needs an artificial stabilization system [UNK] that 's essential at least for the hover and the low-speed flight if that single-stability system that brain that flies that aircraft fails or if the engine fails that vehicle crashes there is no option to that and the adage that i 'm referring to that applied at that time was that nothing comes down faster than a vtol aircraft upside down that 's a macabre comment because we lost a lot of pilots in fact the aircraft companies gave up on vertical-takeoff aircraft more or less for a number of years and there 's really only one operational aircraft in the world today that 's a vertical-takeoff aircraft [UNK] as distinct from a helicopter [UNK] and that 's the hawker harrier jump jet a vertical-takeoff aircraft like the hummingbird has a very high metabolism which means it requires a lot of energy getting that energy is very very difficult it all comes down to that power plant [UNK] how to get a large amount of power in a small package fortunately dr. felix wankel invented the rotary engine a very unique engine [UNK] it 's round it 's small it 's vibration-free it fits exactly where we need to fit it right in the center of the hubs of the ducts in the system [UNK] very critical in fact that engine [UNK] for those who are into the automobile [UNK] know that it recently is applied to the rx8 [UNK] the mazda and that sportscar won sports car of the year wonderful engine in that application it generates one horsepower per pound which is twice as good as your car engine today but only half of what we need my company has spent 35 years and many millions of dollars taking that rotary engine which was invented in the late '50s and getting it to the point that we get over two horsepower per pound reliably and critical we actually get 175 horsepower into one cubic foot we have eight engines in this vehicle we have four computers we have two parachutes redundancy is the critical issue here if you want to stay alive you 've got to have backups and we have actually flown this vehicle and lost an engine and continued to hover the computers back up each other there 's a voting system [UNK] if one computer is not agreeing with the other three it 's kicked out of the system and then you have three [UNK] you still have the triple redundancy if one of those fails you still have a second chance if you stick around then good luck there wo n't be a third chance the parachutes are there [UNK] hopefully more for psychological than real reasons but they will be an ultimate backup if it comes to that i 'd like to show you an animation in this next one which is one element of the skycar 's use but it 's one that demonstrates how it could be used you could think of it personally in your own terms of how you might use it video skycar dispatched launch rescue vehicle for san francisco paul moller i believe that personal transportation in something like the skycar probably in another volantor form as well will be a significant part of our lives as dr. goldin says within the next 10 years and it 's going to change the demographics in a very significant way if you can live 75 miles from san francisco and get there in 15 minutes you 're going to sell your 700,000-dollar apartment buy an upscale home on the side of a mountain buy a skycar which i think would be priced at that time perhaps in the area of 100,000 dollars put money in the bank 1 that 's a very significant incentive for getting out of san francisco but you better be the first one out of town as the real estate values go to hell developing the skycar has been a real challenge obviously i 'm dependent on a lot of other people believing in what i 'm doing [UNK] both financially and in technical help and that has [UNK] you run into situations where you have this great acceptance of what you 're doing and a lot of rejection of the same kind of thing i characterized this emerging technology in an aphorism as it 's described which really talks about what i 've experienced and i 'm sure what other people may have experienced in emerging technologies there 's an interesting poll that came out recently under nas [UNK] i think it 's msnbc [UNK] in which they asked the question " are you in the market for a volantor " twenty-three percent said " yes as soon as possible " forty-seven percent [UNK] yes as soon as they could [UNK] price could come down twenty-three percent said " as soon as it 's proven safe " only seven percent said that they would n't consider buying a skycar i 'm encouraged by that at least it makes me feel like to some extent it is becoming self-evident that we need an alternative to the automobile at least for those 50-mile trips and more so that the highways become usable in today 's world thank you .shall i ask for a show of hands or a clapping of people in different generations i 'm interested in how many are three to 12 years old none huh all right i 'm going to talk about dinosaurs do you remember dinosaurs when you were that age dinosaurs are kind of funny you know we 're going to kind of go in a different direction right now i hope you all realize that so i 'll just give you my message up front try not to go extinct that 's it people ask me a lot [UNK] in fact one of the most asked questions i get is why do children like dinosaurs so much what 's the fascination and i usually just say " well dinosaurs were big different and gone " they 're all gone well that 's not true but we 'll get to the goose in a minute so that 's sort of the theme big different and gone the title of my talk shape-shifting dinosaurs the cause of a premature extinction now i assume that we remember dinosaurs and there 's lots of different shapes lots of different kinds a long time ago back in the early 1900s museums were out looking for dinosaurs they went out and gathered them up and this is an interesting story every museum wanted a little bigger or better one than anybody else had so if the museum in toronto went out and collected a tyrannosaur a big one then the museum in ottawa wanted a bigger one and a better one and that happened for all museums so everyone was out looking for all these bigger and better dinosaurs and this was in the early 1900s by about 1970 some scientists were sitting around and they thought " what in the world look at these dinosaurs they 're all big where are all the little ones " and they thought about it and they even wrote papers about it " where are the little dinosaurs " well go to a museum you 'll see see how many baby dinosaurs there are people assumed [UNK] and this was actually a problem [UNK] people assumed that if they had little dinosaurs if they had juvenile dinosaurs they 'd be easy to identify you 'd have a big dinosaur and a littler dinosaur but all they had were big dinosaurs and it comes down to a couple of things first off scientists have egos and scientists like to name dinosaurs they like to name anything everybody likes to have their own animal that they named and so every time they found something that looked a little different they named it something different and what happened of course is we ended up with a whole bunch of different dinosaurs in 1975 a light went on in somebody 's head dr. peter dodson at the university of pennsylvania actually realized that dinosaurs grew kind of like birds do which is different than the way reptiles grow and in fact he used the cassowary as an example and it 's kind of cool [UNK] if you look at the cassowary or any of the birds that have crests on their heads they actually grow to about 80 percent adult size before the crest starts to grow now think about that they 're basically retaining their juvenile characteristics very late in what we call ontogeny so allometric cranial ontogeny is relative skull growth so you can see that if you actually found one that was 80 percent grown and you did n't know that it was going to grow up to a cassowary you would think they were two different animals so this was a problem and peter dodson pointed this out using some duck-billed dinosaurs then called hypacrosaurus and he showed that if you were to take a baby and an adult and make an average of what it should look like if it grew in sort of a linear fashion it would have a crest about half the size of the adult but the actual sub-adult at 65 percent had no crest at all so this was interesting so this is where people went astray again i mean if they 'd have just taken that taken peter dodson 's work and gone on with that then we would have a lot less dinosaurs than we have but scientists have egos they like to name things and so they went on naming dinosaurs because they were different now we have a way of actually testing to see whether a dinosaur or any animal is a young one or an older one and that 's by actually cutting into their bones but cutting into the bones of a dinosaur is hard to do as you can imagine because in museums bones are precious you go into a museum and they take really good care of them they put them in foam little containers they 're very well taken care of they do n't like it if you come in and want to saw them open and look inside so they do n't normally let you do that but i have a museum and i collect dinosaurs and i can saw mine open so that 's what i do so if you cut open a little dinosaur it 's very spongy inside like a and if you cut into an older dinosaur it 's very massive you can tell it 's mature bone so it 's real easy to tell them apart so what i want to do is show you these in north america in the northern plains of the united states and the southern plains of alberta and saskatchewan there 's this unit of rock called the hell creek formation that produces the last dinosaurs that lived on earth and there are 12 of them that everyone recognizes [UNK] i mean the 12 primary dinosaurs that went extinct and so we will evaluate them and that 's sort of what i 've been doing so my students my staff we 've been cutting them open now as you can imagine cutting open a leg bone is one thing but when you go to a museum and say " you do n't mind if i cut open your dinosaur 's skull do you " they say " go away " so here are 12 dinosaurs and we want to look at these three first so these are dinosaurs that are called pachycephalosaurs and everybody knows that these three animals are related and the assumption is is that they 're related like cousins or whatever but no one ever considered that they might be more closely related in other words people looked at them and they saw the differences and you all know that if you are going to determine whether you 're related to your brother or your sister you ca n't do it by looking at differences you can only determine relatedness by looking for similarities so people were looking at these and they were talking about how different they are pachycephalosaurus has a big thick dome on its head and it 's got some little bumps on the back of its head and it 's got a bunch of gnarly things on the end of its nose and then stygimoloch another dinosaur from the same age lived at the same time has spikes sticking out the back of its head it 's got a little tiny dome and it 's got a bunch of gnarly stuff on its nose and then there 's this thing called dracorex hogwart 's eye guess where that came from dragon so here 's a dinosaur that has spikes sticking out of its head no dome and gnarly stuff on its nose nobody noticed the gnarly stuff sort of looked alike but they did look at these three and they said " these are three different dinosaurs and dracorex is probably the most primitive of them and the other one is more primitive than the other it 's unclear to me how they actually sorted these three of them out but if you line them up if you just take those three skulls and just line them up they line up like this dracorex is the littlest one stygimoloch is the middle size one pachycephalosaurus is the largest one and one would think that should give me a clue but it did n't give them a clue because well we know why scientists like to name things so if we cut open dracorex [UNK] i cut open our dracorex [UNK] and look it was spongy inside really spongy inside i mean it is a juvenile and it 's growing really fast so it is going to get bigger if you cut open stygimoloch it is doing the same thing the dome that little dome is growing really fast it 's inflating very fast what 's interesting is the spike on the back of the dracorex was growing very fast as well the spikes on the back of the stygimoloch are actually resorbing which means they 're getting smaller as that dome is getting bigger and if we look at pachycephalosaurus pachycephalosaurus has a solid dome and its little bumps on the back of its head were also resorbing so just with these three dinosaurs you can easily [UNK] as a scientist [UNK] we can easily hypothesize that it is just a growth series of the same animal which of course means that stygimoloch and dracorex are extinct okay which of course means we have 10 primary dinosaurs to deal with so a colleague of mine at berkley he and i were looking at triceratops and before the year 2000 [UNK] now remember triceratops was first found in the 1800s [UNK] before 2000 no one had ever seen a juvenile triceratops there 's a triceratops in every museum in the world but no one had ever collected a juvenile and we know why right because everybody wants to have a big one so everyone had a big one so we went out and collected a whole bunch of stuff and we found a whole bunch of little ones they 're everywhere they 're all over the place so we have a whole bunch of them at our museum and everybody says it 's because i have a little museum when you have a little museum you have little dinosaurs if you look at the triceratops you can see it 's changing it 's shape-shifting as the juveniles are growing up their horns actually curve backwards and then as they grow older the horns grow forward and that 's pretty cool if you look along the edge of the frill they have these little triangular bones that actually grow big as triangles and then they flatten against the frill pretty much like the spikes do on the pachycephalosaurs and then because the juveniles are in my collection i cut them open and look inside and the little one is really spongy and the middle size one is really spongy but what was interesting was the adult triceratops was also spongy and this is a skull that is two meters long it 's a big skull but there 's another dinosaur that is found in this formation that looks like a triceratops except it 's bigger and it 's called torosaurus and torosaurus when we cut into it has mature bone but it 's got these big holes in its shield and everybody says " a triceratops and a torosaurus ca n't possibly be the same animal because one of them 's bigger than the other one " " and it has holes in its frill " and i said " well do we have any juvenile torosauruses " and they said " well no but it has holes in its frill " so one of my graduate students john scannella looked through our whole collection and he actually discovered that the hole starting to form in triceratops and of course it 's open in torosaurus [UNK] so he found the transitional ones between triceratops and torosaurus which was pretty cool so now we know that torosaurus is actually a grownup triceratops now when we name dinosaurs when we name anything the original name gets to stick and the second name is thrown out so torosaurus is extinct triceratops if you 've heard the news a lot of the newscasters got it all wrong they thought torosaurus should be kept and triceratops thrown out but that 's not going to happen all right so we can do this with a bunch of dinosaurs i mean here 's edmontosaurus and anatotitan anatotitan giant duck it 's a giant duck-bill dinosaur here 's another one so we look at the bone histology the bone histology tells us that edmontosaurus is a juvenile or at least a sub-adult and the other one is an adult and we have an ontogeny and we get rid of anatotitan so we can just keep doing this and the last one is t. rex so there 's these two dinosaurs t. rex and nanotyrannus again makes you wonder but they had a good question they were looking at them and they said " one 's got 17 teeth and the biggest one 's got 12 teeth and that does n't make any sense at all because we do n't know of any dinosaurs that gain teeth as they get older so it must be true [UNK] they must be different " so we cut into them and sure enough nanotyrannus has juvenile bone and the bigger one has more mature bone it looks like it could still get bigger and at the museum of the rockies where we work i have four t. rexes so i can cut a whole bunch of them but i did n't have to cut any of them really because i just lined up their jaws and it turned out the biggest one had 12 teeth and the next smallest one had 13 and the next smallest had 14 and of course nano has 17 and we just went out and looked at other people 's collections and we found one that has sort of 15 teeth so again real easy to say that tyrannosaurus ontogeny included nanotyrannus and therefore we can take out another dinosaur so when it comes down to our end cretaceous we have seven left and that 's a good number that 's a good number to go extinct i think now as you can imagine this is not very popular with fourth-graders fourth-graders love their dinosaurs they memorize them and they 're not happy with this thank you very much .we all make decisions every day we want to know what the right thing is to do [UNK] in domains from the financial to the gastronomic to the professional to the romantic and surely if somebody could really tell us how to do exactly the right thing at all possible times that would be a tremendous gift it turns out that in fact the world was given this gift in 1738 by a dutch polymath named daniel bernoulli and what i want to talk to you about today is what that gift is and i also want to explain to you why it is that it has n't made a damn bit of difference now this is bernoulli 's gift this is a direct quote and if it looks like greek to you it 's because well it 's greek but the simple english translation [UNK] much less precise but it captures the gist of what bernoulli had to say [UNK] was this the expected value of any of our actions [UNK] that is the goodness that we can count on getting [UNK] is the product of two simple things the odds that this action will allow us to gain something and the value of that gain to us in a sense what bernoulli was saying is if we can estimate and multiply these two things we will always know precisely how we should behave now this simple equation even for those of you who do n't like equations is something that you 're quite used to here 's an example if i were to tell you let 's play a little coin toss game and i 'm going to flip a coin and if it comes up heads i 'm going to pay you 10 dollars but you have to pay four dollars for the privilege of playing with me most of you would say sure i 'll take that bet because you know that the odds of you winning are one half the gain if you do is 10 dollars that multiplies to five and that 's more than i 'm charging you to play so the answer is yes this is what statisticians technically call a damn fine bet now the idea is simple when we 're applying it to coin tosses but in fact it 's not very simple in everyday life people are horrible at estimating both of these things and that 's what i want to talk to you about today there are two kinds of errors people make when trying to decide what the right thing is to do and those are errors in estimating the odds that they 're going to succeed and errors in estimating the value of their own success now let me talk about the first one first calculating odds would seem to be something rather easy there are six sides to a die two sides to a coin 52 cards in a deck you all know what the likelihood is of pulling the ace of spades or of flipping a heads but as it turns out this is not a very easy idea to apply in everyday life that 's why americans spend more [UNK] i should say lose more [UNK] gambling than on all other forms of entertainment combined the reason is this is n't how people do odds the way people figure odds requires that we first talk a bit about pigs now the question i 'm going to put to you is whether you think there are more dogs or pigs on leashes observed in any particular day in oxford and of course you all know that the answer is dogs and the way that you know that the answer is dogs is you quickly reviewed in memory the times you 've seen dogs and pigs on leashes it was very easy to remember seeing dogs not so easy to remember pigs and each one of you assumed that if dogs on leashes came more quickly to your mind then dogs on leashes are more probable that 's not a bad rule of thumb except when it is so for example here 's a word puzzle are there more four-letter english words with r in the third place or r in the first place well you check memory very briefly make a quick scan and it 's awfully easy to say to yourself ring rang rung and very hard to say to yourself pare park they come more slowly but in fact there are many more words in the english language with r in the third than the first place the reason words with r in the third place come slowly to your mind is n't because they 're improbable unlikely or infrequent it 's because the mind recalls words by their first letter you kind of shout out the sound s [UNK] and the word comes it 's like the dictionary it 's hard to look things up by the third letter so this is an example of how this idea that the quickness with which things come to mind can give you a sense of their probability [UNK] how this idea could lead you astray it 's not just puzzles though for example when americans are asked to estimate the odds that they will die in a variety of interesting ways [UNK] these are estimates of number of deaths per year per 200 million u.s. citizens and these are just ordinary people like yourselves who are asked to guess how many people die from tornado fireworks asthma drowning etc compare these to the actual numbers now you see a very interesting pattern here which is first of all two things are vastly over-estimated namely tornadoes and fireworks two things are vastly underestimated dying by drowning and dying by asthma why when was the last time that you picked up a newspaper and the headline was " boy dies of asthma " it 's not interesting because it 's so common it 's very easy for all of us to bring to mind instances of news stories or newsreels where we 've seen tornadoes devastating cities or some poor schmuck who 's blown his hands off with a firework on the fourth of july drownings and asthma deaths do n't get much coverage they do n't come quickly to mind and as a result we vastly underestimate them indeed this is kind of like the sesame street game of " which thing does n't belong " and you 're right to say it 's the swimming pool that does n't belong because the swimming pool is the only thing on this slide that 's actually very dangerous the way that more of you are likely to die than the combination the lottery is an excellent example of course [UNK] an excellent test-case of people 's ability to compute probabilities and economists [UNK] forgive me for those of you who play the lottery [UNK] but economists at least among themselves refer to the lottery as a stupidity tax because the odds of getting any payoff by investing your money in a lottery ticket are approximately equivalent to flushing the money directly down the toilet [UNK] which by the way does n't require that you actually go to the store and buy anything why in the world would anybody ever play the lottery well there are many answers but one answer surely is we see a lot of winners right when this couple wins the lottery or ed mcmahon shows up at your door with this giant check [UNK] how the hell do you cash things that size i do n't know we see this on tv we read about it in the paper when was the last time that you saw extensive interviews with everybody who lost indeed if we required that television stations run a 30-second interview with each loser every time they interview a winner the 100 million losers in the last lottery would require nine-and-a-half years of your undivided attention just to watch them say " me i lost " " me i lost " now if you watch nine-and-a-half years of television [UNK] no sleep no potty breaks [UNK] and you saw loss after loss after loss and then at the end there 's 30 seconds of " and i won " the likelihood that you would play the lottery is very small look i can prove this to you here 's a little lottery there 's 10 tickets in this lottery nine of them have been sold to these individuals it costs you a dollar to buy the ticket and if you win you get 20 bucks is this a good bet well bernoulli tells us it is the expected value of this lottery is two dollars this is a lottery in which you should invest your money and most people say " ok i 'll play " now a slightly different version of this lottery imagine that the nine tickets are all owned by one fat guy named leroy leroy has nine tickets there 's one left do you want it most people wo n't play this lottery now you can see the odds of winning have n't changed but it 's now fantastically easy to imagine who 's going to win it 's easy to see leroy getting the check right you ca n't say to yourself " i 'm as likely to win as anybody " because you 're not as likely to win as leroy the fact that all those tickets are owned by one guy changes your decision to play even though it does nothing whatsoever to the odds now estimating odds as difficult as it may seem is a piece of cake compared to trying to estimate value trying to say what something is worth how much we 'll enjoy it how much pleasure it will give us i want to talk now about errors in value how much is this big mac worth is it worth 25 dollars most of you have the intuition that it 's not [UNK] you would n't pay that for it but in fact to decide whether a big mac is worth 25 dollars requires that you ask one and only one question which is what else can i do with 25 dollars if you 've ever gotten on one of those long-haul flights to australia and realized that they 're not going to serve you any food but somebody in the row in front of you has just opened the mcdonald 's bag and the smell of golden arches is wafting over the seat you think i ca n't do anything else with this 25 dollars for 16 hours i ca n't even set it on fire [UNK] they took my cigarette lighter 1 suddenly 25 dollars for a big mac might be a good deal on the other hand if you 're visiting an underdeveloped country and 25 dollars buys you a gourmet meal it 's exorbitant for a big mac why were you all sure that the answer to the question was no before i 'd even told you anything about the context because most of you compared the price of this big mac to the price you 're used to paying rather than asking " what else can i do with my money " comparing this investment to other possible investments you compared to the past and this is a systematic error people make what you knew is you paid three dollars in the past 25 is outrageous this is an error and i can prove it to you by showing the kinds of irrationalities to which it leads for example this is of course one of the most delicious tricks in marketing is to say something used to be higher and suddenly it seems like a very good deal when people are asked about these two different jobs a job where you make 60k then 50k then 40k a job where you 're getting a salary cut each year and one in which you 're getting a salary increase people like the second job better than the first despite the fact they 're all told they make much less money why because they had the sense that declining wages are worse than rising wages even when the total amount of wages is higher in the declining period here 's another nice example here 's a $ 2,000 hawaiian vacation package it 's now on sale for 1,600 assuming you wanted to go to hawaii would you buy this package most people say they would here 's a slightly different story $ 2,000 hawaiian vacation package is now on sale for 700 dollars so you decide to mull it over for a week by the time you get to the ticket agency the best fares are gone [UNK] the package now costs 1,500 would you buy it most people say no why because it used to cost 700 and there 's no way i 'm paying 1,500 for something that was 700 last week this tendency to compare to the past is causing people to pass up the better deal in other words a good deal that used to be a great deal is not nearly as good as an awful deal that was once a horrible deal here 's another example of how comparing to the past can befuddle our decisions imagine that you 're going to the theater you 're on your way to the theater in your wallet you have a ticket for which you paid 20 dollars you also have a 20-dollar bill when you arrive at the theater you discover that somewhere along the way you 've lost the ticket would you spend your remaining money on replacing it most people answer no now let 's just change one thing in this scenario you 're on your way to the theater and in your wallet you have two 20-dollar bills when you arrive you discover you 've lost one of them would you spend your remaining 20 dollars on a ticket well of course i went to the theater to see the play what does the loss of 20 dollars along the way have to do now just in case you 're not getting it here 's a schematic of what happened ok along the way you lost something in both cases it was a piece of paper in one case it had a u.s. president on it in the other case it did n't what the hell difference should it make the difference is that when you lost the ticket you say to yourself i 'm not paying twice for the same thing you compare the cost of the play now [UNK] 40 dollars [UNK] to the cost that it used to have [UNK] 20 dollars [UNK] and you say it 's a bad deal comparing with the past causes many of the problems that behavioral economists and psychologists identify in people 's attempts to assign value but even when we compare with the possible instead of the past we still make certain kinds of mistakes and i 'm going to show you one or two of them one of the things we know about comparison that when we compare one thing to the other it changes its value so in 1992 this fellow george bush for those of us who were kind of on the liberal side of the political spectrum did n't seem like such a great guy suddenly we 're almost longing for him to return the comparison changes how we evaluate him now retailers knew this long before anybody else did of course and they use this wisdom to help you [UNK] spare you the undue burden of money and so a retailer if you were to go into a wine shop and you had to buy a bottle of wine and you see them here for eight 27 and 33 dollars what would you do most people do n't want the most expensive they do n't want the least expensive so they will opt for the item in the middle if you 're a smart retailer then you will put a very expensive item that nobody will ever buy on the shelf because suddenly the $ 33 wine does n't look as expensive in comparison so i 'm telling you something you already knew namely that comparison changes the value of things here 's why that 's a problem the problem is that when you get that $ 33 bottle of wine home it wo n't matter what it used to be sitting on the shelf next to the comparisons we make when we are appraising value where we 're trying to estimate how much we 'll like things are not the same comparisons we 'll be making when we consume them this problem of shifting comparisons can bedevil our attempts to make rational decisions let me just give you an example i have to show you something from my own lab so let me sneak this in these are subjects coming to an experiment to be asked the simplest of all questions how much will you enjoy eating potato chips one minute from now they 're sitting in a room with potato chips in front of them for some of the subjects sitting in the far corner of a room is a box of godiva chocolates and for others is a can of spam in fact these items that are sitting in the room change how much the subjects think they 're going to enjoy the potato chips namely those who are looking at spam think potato chips are going to be quite tasty those who are looking at godiva chocolate think they wo n't be nearly so tasty of course what happens when they eat the potato chips well look you did n't need a psychologist to tell you that when you have a mouthful of greasy salty crispy delicious snacks what 's sitting in the corner of the room makes not a damn bit of difference to your gustatory experience nonetheless their predictions are perverted by a comparison that then does not carry through and change their experience you 've all experienced this yourself even if you 've never come into our lab to eat potato chips so here 's a question you want to buy a car stereo the dealer near your house sells this particular stereo for 200 dollars but if you drive across town you can get it for 100 bucks so would you drive to get 50 percent off saving 100 dollars most people say they would they ca n't imagine buying it for twice the price when with one trip across town they can get it for half off now let 's imagine instead you wanted to buy a car that had a stereo and the dealer near your house had it for 31,000 but if you drove across town you could get it for 30,900 would you drive to get it at this point 0.003 savings [UNK] the 100 dollars most people say no i 'm going to schlep across town to save 100 bucks on the purchase of a car this kind of thinking drives economists crazy and it should because this 100 dollars that you save [UNK] hello 1 [UNK] does n't know where it came from it does n't know what you saved it on when you go to buy groceries with it it does n't go i 'm the money saved on the car stereo or i 'm the dumb money saved on the car it 's money and if a drive across town is worth 100 bucks it 's worth 100 bucks no matter what you 're saving it on people do n't think that way that 's why they do n't know whether their mutual fund manager is taking 0.1 percent or 0.15 percent of their investment but they clip coupons to save one dollar off of toothpaste now you can see this is the problem of shifting comparisons because what you 're doing is you 're comparing the 100 bucks to the purchase that you 're making but when you go to spend that money you wo n't be making that comparison you 've all had this experience if you 're an american for example you 've probably traveled in france and at some point you may have met a couple from your own hometown and you thought " oh my god these people are so warm they 're so nice to me i mean compared to all these people who hate me when i try to speak their language and hate me more when i do n't these people are just wonderful " and so you tour france with them and then you get home and you invite them over for dinner and what do you find compared to your regular friends they are boring and dull right because in this new context the comparison is very very different in fact you find yourself disliking them enough almost to qualify for french citizenship now you have exactly the same problem when you shop for a stereo you go to the stereo store you see two sets of speakers [UNK] these big boxy monoliths and these little sleek speakers and you play them and you go you know i do hear a difference the big ones sound a little better and so you buy them and you bring them home and you entirely violate the décor of your house and the problem of course is that this comparison you made in the store is a comparison you 'll never make again what are the odds that years later you 'll turn on the stereo and go " sounds so much better than those little ones " which you ca n't even remember hearing the problem of shifting comparisons is even more difficult when these choices are arrayed over time people have a lot of trouble making decisions about things that will happen at different points in time and what psychologists and behavioral economists have discovered is that by and large people use two simple rules so let me give you one very easy problem a second very easy problem and then a third hard problem here 's the first easy problem you can have 60 dollars now or 50 dollars now which would you prefer this is what we call a one-item iq test ok all of us i hope prefer more money and the reason is we believe more is better than less here 's the second problem you can have 60 dollars today or 60 dollars in a month which would you prefer again an easy decision because we all know that now is better than later what 's hard in our decision-making is when these two rules conflict for example when you 're offered 50 dollars now or 60 dollars in a month this typifies a lot of situations in life in which you will gain by waiting but you have to be patient what do we know what do people do in these kinds of situations well by and large people are enormously impatient that is they require interest rates in the hundred or thousands of percents in order to delay gratification and wait until next month for the extra 10 dollars maybe that is n't so remarkable but what is remarkable is how easy it is to make this impatience go away by simply changing when the delivery of these monetary units will happen imagine that you can have 50 dollars in a year [UNK] that 's 12 months [UNK] or 60 dollars in 13 months what do we find now people are gladly willing to wait as long as they 're waiting 12 they might as well wait 13 what makes this dynamic inconsistency happen comparison troubling comparison let me show you this is just a graph showing the results that i just suggested you would show if i gave you time to respond which is people find that the subjective value of 50 is higher than the subjective value of 60 when they 'll be delivered in now or one month respectively [UNK] a 30-day delay [UNK] but they show the reverse pattern when you push the entire decision off into the future a year now why in the world do you get this pattern of results these guys can tell us what you see here are two lads one of them larger than the other the fireman and the fiddler they are going to recede towards the vanishing point in the horizon and i want you to notice two things at no point will the fireman look taller than the fiddler no point however the difference between them seems to be getting smaller first it 's an inch in your view then it 's a quarter-inch then a half-inch and then finally they go off the edge of the earth here are the results of what i just showed you this is the subjective height [UNK] the height you saw of these guys at various points and i want you to see that two things are true one the farther away they are the smaller they look and two the fireman is always bigger than the fiddler but watch what happens when we make some of them disappear right at a very close distance the fiddler looks taller than the fireman but at a far distance their normal their true relations are preserved as plato said what space is to size time is to value these are the results of the hard problem i gave you 60 now or 50 in a month and these are subjective values and what you can see is our two rules are preserved people always think more is better than less 60 is always better than 50 and they always think now is better than later the bars on this side are higher than the bars on this side watch what happens when we drop some out suddenly we have the dynamic inconsistency that puzzled us we have the tendency for people to go for 50 dollars now over waiting a month but not if that decision is far in the future notice something interesting that this implies [UNK] namely that when people get to the future they will change their minds that is as that month 12 approaches you will say what was i thinking waiting an extra month for 60 dollars i 'll take the 50 dollars now well the question with which i 'd like to end is this if we 're so damn stupid how did we get to the moon because i could go on for about two hours with evidence of people 's inability to estimate odds and inability to estimate value the answer to this question i think is an answer you 've already heard in some of the talks and i dare say you will hear again namely that our brains were evolved for a very different world than the one in which we are living they were evolved for a world in which people lived in very small groups rarely met anybody who was terribly different from themselves had rather short lives in which there were few choices and the highest priority was to eat and mate today bernoulli 's gift bernoulli 's little formula allows us it tells us how we should think in a world for which nature never designed us that explains why we are so bad at using it but it also explains why it is so terribly important that we become good fast we are the only species on this planet that has ever held its own fate in its hands we have no significant predators we 're the masters of our physical environment the things that normally cause species to become extinct are no longer any threat to us the only thing [UNK] the only thing [UNK] that can destroy us and doom us are our own decisions if we 're not here in 10,000 years it 's going to be because we could not take advantage of the gift given to us by a young dutch fellow in 1738 because we underestimated the odds of our future pains and overestimated the value of our present pleasures thank you chris anderson that was remarkable we have time for some questions for dan gilbert one and two bill lyell would you say that this mechanism is in part how terrorism actually works to frighten us and is there some way that we could counteract that dan gilbert i actually was consulting recently with the department of homeland security which generally believes that american security dollars should go to making borders safer i tried to point out to them that terrorism was a name based on people 's psychological reaction to a set of events and that if they were concerned about terrorism they might ask what causes terror and how can we stop people from being terrified rather than [UNK] not rather than but in addition to stopping the atrocities that we 're all concerned about surely the kinds of play that at least american media give to [UNK] and forgive me but in raw numbers these are very tiny accidents we already know for example in the united states more people have died as a result of not taking airplanes [UNK] because they were scared [UNK] and driving on highways than were killed in 911 ok if i told you that there was a plague that was going to kill 15,000 americans next year you might be alarmed if you did n't find out it was the flu these are small-scale accidents and we should be wondering whether they should get the kind of play the kind of coverage that they do surely that causes people to overestimate the likelihood that they 'll be hurt in these various ways and gives power to the very people who want to frighten us ca dan i 'd like to hear more on this so you 're saying that our response to terror is i mean it 's a form of mental bug talk more about it dg it 's out-sized i mean look if australia disappears tomorrow terror is probably the right response that 's an awful large lot of very nice people on the other hand when a bus blows up and 30 people are killed more people than that were killed by not using their seatbelts in the same country is terror the right response ca what causes the bug is it the drama of the event [UNK] that it 's so spectacular is it the fact that it 's an intentional attack by quote outsiders what is it dg yes it 's a number of things and you hit on several of them first it 's a human agent trying to kill us [UNK] it 's not a tree falling on us by accident second these are enemies who may want to strike and hurt us again people are being killed for no reason instead of good reason [UNK] as if there 's good reason but sometimes people think there are so there are a number of things that together make this seem like a fantastic event but let 's not play down the fact that newspapers sell when people see something in it they want to read so there 's a large role here played by the media who want these things to be as spectacular as they possibly can ca i mean what would it take to persuade our culture to downplay it dg well go to israel you know go to israel and a mall blows up and then everybody 's unhappy about it and an hour-and-a-half later [UNK] at least when i was there and i was 150 feet from the mall when it blew up [UNK] i went back to my hotel and the wedding that was planned was still going on and as the israeli mother said she said " we never let them win by stopping weddings " i mean this is a society that has learned [UNK] and there are others too [UNK] that has learned to live with a certain amount of terrorism and not be quite as upset by it shall i say as those of us who have not had many terror attacks ca but is there a rational fear that actually the reason we 're frightened about this is because we think that the big one is to come dg yes of course so if we knew that this was the worst attack there would ever be there might be more and more buses of 30 people [UNK] we would probably not be nearly so frightened i do n't want to say [UNK] please i 'm going to get quoted somewhere as saying " terrorism is fine and we should n't be so distressed " that 's not my point at all what i 'm saying is that surely rationally our distress about things that happen about threats should be roughly proportional to the size of those threats and threats to come i think in the case of terrorism it is n't and many of the things we 've heard about from our speakers today [UNK] how many people do you know got up and said poverty 1 i ca n't believe what poverty is doing to us people get up in the morning they do n't care about poverty it 's not making headlines it 's not making news it 's not flashy there are no guns going off i mean if you had to solve one of these problems chris which would you solve terrorism or poverty that 's a tough one ca there 's no question poverty by an order of magnitude a huge order of magnitude unless someone can show that there 's you know terrorists with a nuke are really likely to come the latest i 've read seen thought is that it 's incredibly hard for them to do that if that turns out to be wrong we all look silly but with poverty it 's a bit [UNK] dg even if that were true still more people die from poverty ca we 've evolved to get all excited about these dramatic attacks is that because in the past in the ancient past we just did n't understand things like disease and systems that cause poverty and so forth and so it made no sense for us as a species to put any energy into worrying about those things people died so be it but if you got attacked that was something you could do something about and so we evolved these responses is that what happened dg well you know the people who are most skeptical about leaping to evolutionary explanations for everything are the evolutionary psychologists themselves my guess is that there 's nothing quite that specific in our evolutionary past but rather if you 're looking for an evolutionary explanation you might say that most organisms are neo-phobic [UNK] that is they 're a little scared of stuff that 's new and different and there 's a good reason to be because old stuff did n't eat you right any animal you see that you 've seen before is less likely to be a predator than one that you 've never seen before so you know when a school bus is blown up and we 've never seen this before our general tendency is to orient towards that which is new and novel is activated i do n't think it 's quite as specific a mechanism as the one you alluded to but maybe a more fundamental one underlying it jay walker you know economists love to talk about the stupidity of people who buy lottery tickets but i suspect you 're making the exact same error you 're accusing those people of which is the error of value i know because i 've interviewed about 1,000 lottery buyers over the years it turns out that the value of buying a lottery ticket is not winning that 's what you think it is all right the average lottery buyer buys about 150 tickets a year so the buyer knows full well that he or she is going to lose and yet she buys 150 tickets a year why is that it 's not because she is stupid or he is stupid it 's because the anticipation of possibly winning releases serotonin in the brain and actually provides a good feeling until the drawing indicates you 've lost or to put it another way for the dollar investment you can have a much better feeling than flushing the money down the toilet which you can not have a good feeling from now economists tend to [UNK] [UNK] economists tend to view the world through their own lenses which is this is just a bunch of stupid people and as a result many people look at economists as stupid people and so fundamentally the reason we got to the moon is we did n't listen to the economists thank you very much dg well no it 's a great point it remains to be seen whether the joy of anticipation is exactly equaled by the amount of disappointment after the lottery because remember people who did n't buy tickets do n't feel awful the next day either even though they do n't feel great during the drawing i would disagree that people know they 're not going to win i think they think it 's unlikely but it could happen which is why they prefer that to the flushing but certainly i see your point that there can be some utility to buying a lottery ticket other than winning now i think there 's many good reasons not to listen to economists that is n't one of them for me but there 's many others ca last question aubrey de grey my name 's aubrey de grey from cambridge i work on the thing that kills more people than anything else kills [UNK] i work on aging [UNK] and i 'm interested in doing something about it as we 'll all hear tomorrow i very much resonate with what you 're saying because it seems to me that the problem with getting people interested in doing anything about aging is that by the time aging is about to kill you it looks like cancer or heart disease or whatever do you have any advice dg for you or for them adg in persuading them dg ah for you in persuading them well it 's notoriously difficult to get people to be farsighted but one thing that psychologists have tried that seems to work is to get people to imagine the future more vividly one of the problems with making decisions about the far future and the near future is that we imagine the near future much more vividly than the far future to the extent that you can equalize the amount of detail that people put into the mental representations of near and far future people begin to make decisions about the two in the same way so would you like to have an extra 100,000 dollars when you 're 65 is a question that 's very different than imagine who you 'll be when you 're 65 will you be living what will you look like how much hair will you have who will you be living with once we have all the details of that imaginary scenario suddenly we feel like it might be important to save so that that guy has a little retirement money but these are tricks around the margins i think in general you 're battling a very fundamental human tendency which is to say " i 'm here today and so now is more important than later " ca dan thank you members of the audience that was a fantastic session thank you .i am a conductor and i 'm here today to talk to you about trust my job depends upon it there has to be between me and the orchestra an unshakable bond of trust born out of mutual respect through which we can spin a musical narrative that we all believe in now in the old days conducting music making was less about trust and more frankly about coercion up to and around about the second world war conductors were invariably dictators [UNK] these tyrannical figures who would rehearse not just the orchestra as a whole but individuals within it within an inch of their lives but i 'm happy to say now that the world has moved on music has moved on with it we now have a more democratic view and way of making music [UNK] a two-way street i as the conductor have to come to the rehearsal with a cast-iron sense of the outer architecture of that music within which there is then immense personal freedom for the members of the orchestra to shine for myself of course i have to completely trust my body language that 's all i have at the point of sale it 's silent gesture i can hardly bark out instructions while we 're playing ladies and gentlemen the scottish ensemble so in order for all this to work obviously i have got to be in a position of trust i have to trust the orchestra and even more crucially i have to trust myself think about it when you 're in a position of not trusting what do you do you overcompensate and in my game that means you overgesticulate you end up like some kind of rabid windmill and the bigger your gesture gets the more ill-defined blurry and frankly useless it is to the orchestra you become a figure of fun there 's no trust anymore only ridicule and i remember at the beginning of my career again and again on these dismal outings with orchestras i would be going completely insane on the podium trying to engender a small scale crescendo really just a little upsurge in volume bugger me they would n't give it to me i spent a lot of time in those early years weeping silently in dressing rooms and how futile seemed the words of advice to me from great british veteran conductor sir colin davis who said " conducting charles is like holding a small bird in your hand if you hold it too tightly you crush it if you hold it too loosely it flies away " i have to say in those days i could n't really even find the bird now a fundamental and really viscerally important experience for me in terms of music has been my adventures in south africa the most dizzyingly musical country on the planet in my view but a country which through its musical culture has taught me one fundamental lesson that through music making can come deep levels of fundamental life-giving trust back in 2000 i had the opportunity to go to south africa to form a new opera company so i went out there and i auditioned mainly in rural township locations right around the country i heard about 2,000 singers and pulled together a company of 40 of the most jaw-droppingly amazing young performers the majority of whom were black but there were a handful of white performers now it emerged early on in the first rehearsal period that one of those white performers had in his previous incarnation been a member of the south african police force and in the last years of the old regime he would routinely be detailed to go into the township to aggress the community now you can imagine what this knowledge did to the temperature in the room the general atmosphere let 's be under no illusions in south africa the relationship most devoid of trust is that between a white policeman and the black community so how do we recover from that ladies and gentlemen simply through singing we sang we sang we sang and amazingly new trust grew and indeed friendship blossomed and that showed me such a fundamental truth that music making and other forms of creativity can so often go to places where mere words can not so we got some shows off the ground we started touring them internationally one of them was " carmen " we then thought we 'd make a movie of " carmen " which we recorded and shot outside on location in the township outside cape town called khayelitsha the piece was sung entirely in xhosa which is a beautifully musical language if you do n't know it it 's called " u-carmen e-khayelitsha " [UNK] literally " carmen of khayelitsha " i want to play you a tiny clip of it now for no other reason than to give you proof positive that there is nothing tiny about south african music making something which i find utterly enchanting about south african music making is that it 's so free south africans just make music really freely and i think in no small way that 's due to one fundamental fact they 're not bound to a system of notation they do n't read music they trust their ears you can teach a bunch of south africans a tune in about five seconds flat and then as if by magic they will spontaneously improvise a load of harmony around that tune because they can now those of us that live in the west if i can use that term i think have a much more hidebound attitude or sense of music [UNK] that somehow it 's all about skill and systems therefore it 's the exclusive preserve of an elite talented body and yet ladies and gentlemen every single one of us on this planet probably engages with music on a daily basis and if i can broaden this out for a second i 'm willing to bet that every single one of you sitting in this room would be happy to speak with acuity with total confidence about movies probably about literature but how many of you would be able to make a confident assertion about a piece of classical music why is this and what i 'm going to say to you now is i 'm just urging you to get over this supreme lack of self-confidence to take the plunge to believe that you can trust your ears you can hear some of the fundamental muscle tissue fiber dna what makes a great piece of music great i 've got a little experiment i want to try with you did you know that ted is a tune a very simple tune based on three notes [UNK] t e d now hang on a minute i know you 're going to say to me " t does n't exist in music " well ladies and gentlemen there 's a time-honored system which composers have been using for hundreds of years which proves actually that it does if i sing you a musical scale a b c d e f g [UNK] and i just carry on with the next set of letters in the alphabet same scale h i j k l m n o p q r s t [UNK] there you go t see it 's the same as f in music so t is f so t e d is the same as f e d. now that piece of music that we played at the start of this session had enshrined in its heart the theme which is ted have a listen do you hear it or do i smell some doubt in the room okay we 'll play it for you again now and we 're going to highlight we 're going to poke out the t e d if you 'll pardon the expression oh my goodness me there it was loud and clear surely i think we should make this even more explicit ladies and gentlemen it 's nearly time for tea would you reckon you need to sing for your tea i think i think we need to sing for our tea we 're going to sing those three wonderful notes t e d will you have a go for me audience t e d charles hazlewood yeah you sound a bit more like cows really than human beings shall we try that one again and look if you 're adventurous you go up the octave t e d audience t e d ch once more with vim there i am like a bloody windmill again you see now we 're going to put that in the context of the music the music will start and then at a signal from me you will sing that one more time with feeling ladies and gentlemen you wo n't make the key otherwise well done ladies and gentlemen it was n't a bad debut for the ted choir not a bad debut at all now there 's a project that i 'm initiating at the moment that i 'm very excited about and wanted to share with you because it is all about changing perceptions and indeed building a new level of trust the youngest of my children was born with cerebral palsy which as you can imagine if you do n't have an experience of it yourself is quite a big thing to take on board but the gift that my gorgeous daughter has given me aside from her very existence is that it 's opened my eyes to a whole stretch of the community that was hitherto hidden the community of disabled people and i found myself looking at the paralympics and thinking how incredible how technology 's been harnessed to prove beyond doubt that disability is no barrier to the highest levels of sporting achievement of course there 's a grimmer side to that truth which is that it 's actually taken decades for the world at large to come to a position of trust to really believe that disability and sports can go together in a convincing and interesting fashion so i find myself asking where is music in all of this you ca n't tell me that there are n't millions of disabled people in the u.k. alone with massive musical potential so i decided to create a platform for that potential it 's going to be britain 's first ever national disabled orchestra it 's called paraorchestra i 'm going to show you a clip now of the very first improvisation session that we had it was a really extraordinary moment just me and four astonishingly gifted disabled musicians normally when you improvise [UNK] and i do it all the time around the world [UNK] there 's this initial period of horror like everyone 's too frightened to throw the hat into the ring an awful pregnant silence then suddenly as if by magic bang 1 we 're all in there and it 's complete bedlam you ca n't hear anything no one 's listening no one 's trusting no one 's responding to each other now in this room with these four disabled musicians within five minutes a rapt listening a rapt response and some really insanely beautiful music nicholas my name 's nicholas mccarthy i 'm 22 and i 'm a left-handed pianist and i was born without my left hand [UNK] right hand can i do that one again lyn when i 'm making music i feel like a pilot in the cockpit flying an airplane i become alive clarence i would rather be able to play an instrument again than walk there 's so much joy and things i could get from playing an instrument and performing it 's removed some of my paralysis ch i only wish that some of those musicians were here with us today so you could see at firsthand how utterly extraordinary they are paraorchestra is the name of that project if any of you thinks you want to help me in any way to achieve what is a fairly impossible and implausible dream still at this point please let me know now my parting shot comes courtesy of the great joseph haydn wonderful austrian composer in the second half of the 18th century [UNK] spent the bulk of his life in the employ of prince nikolaus esterhazy along with his orchestra now this prince loved his music but he also loved the country castle that he tended to reside in most of the time which is just on the austro-hungarian border a place called esterhazy [UNK] a long way from the big city of vienna now one day in 1772 the prince decreed that the musicians ' families the orchestral musicians ' families were no longer welcome in the castle they were n't allowed to stay there anymore they had to be returned to vienna [UNK] as i say an unfeasibly long way away in those days you can imagine the musicians were disconsolate haydn remonstrated with the prince but to no avail so given the prince loved his music haydn thought he 'd write a symphony to make the point and we 're going to play just the very tail end of this symphony now and you 'll see the orchestra in a kind of sullen revolt i 'm pleased to say the prince did take the tip from the orchestral performance and the musicians were reunited with their families but i think it sums up my talk rather well this that where there is trust there is music [UNK] by extension life where there is no trust the music quite simply withers away .i draw to better understand things sometimes i make a lot of drawings and i still do n't understand what it is i 'm drawing those of you who are comfortable with digital stuff and even smug about that relationship might be amused to know that the guy who is best known for " the way things work " while preparing for part of a panel for called understanding spent two days trying to get his laptop to communicate with his new cd burner who knew about extension managers i 've always managed my own extensions so it never even occurred to me to read the instructions but i did finally figure it out i had to figure it out because along with the invitation came the frightening reminder that there would be no projector so bringing those carousels would no longer be necessary but some alternate form of communication would now i could talk about something that i 'm known for something that would be particularly appropriate for many of the more technically minded people here or i could talk about something i really care about i decided to go with the latter i 'm going to talk about rome now why would i care about rome particularly well i went to rhode island school of design in the second half of the '60s to study architecture i was lucky enough to spend my last year my fifth year in rome as a student it changed my life not the least reason was the fact that i had spent those first four years living at home driving into risd everyday driving back i missed the '60s i read about them i understand they were pretty interesting i missed them but i did spend that extraordinary year in rome and it 's a place that is never far from my mind so whenever given an opportunity i try to do something in it or with it or for it i also make drawings to help people understand things things that i want them to believe i understand and that 's what i do as an illustrator that 's my job so i 'm going to show you some pictures of rome i 've made a lot of drawings of rome over the years these are just drawings of rome i get back as often as possible [UNK] i need to all different materials all different styles all different times drawings from sketchbooks looking at the details of rome part of the reason i 'm showing you these is that it sort of helps illustrate this process i go through of trying to figure out what it is i feel about rome and why i feel it these are sketches of some of the little details rome is a city full of surprises i mean we 're talking about unusual perspectives we 're talking about narrow little winding streets that suddenly open into vast sun-drenched piazzas [UNK] never though piazzas that are not humanly scaled part of the reason for that is the fact that they grew up organically that amazing juxtaposition of old and new the bits of light that come down between the buildings that sort of create a map that 's traveling above your head of usually blue [UNK] especially in the summer [UNK] compared to the map that you would normally expect to see of conventional streets and i began to think about how i could communicate this in book form how could i share my sense of rome my understanding of rome and i 'm going to show you a bunch of dead ends basically the primary reason for all these dead ends is when if you 're not quite sure where you 're going you 're certainly not going to get there with any kind of efficiency here 's a little map and i thought of maps at the beginning maybe i should just try and do a little atlas of my favorite streets and connections in rome and here 's a line of text that actually evolves from the exhaust of a scooter zipping across the page here that same line of text wraps around a fountain in an illustration that can be turned upside down and read both ways maybe that line of text could be a story to help give some human aspect to this maybe i should get away from this map completely and really be honest about wanting to show you my favorite bits and pieces of rome and simply kick a soccer ball in the air [UNK] which happens in so many of the squares in the city [UNK] and let it bounce off of things and i 'll simply explain what each of those things is that the soccer ball hits that seemed like a sort of a cheap shot but even though i just started this presentation this is not the first thing that i tried to do and i was getting sort of desperate eventually i realized that i had really no content that i could count on so i decided to move towards packaging i mean it seems to work for a lot of things so i thought a little box set of four small books might do the trick but one of the ideas that emerged from some of those sketches was the notion of traveling through rome in different vehicles at different speeds in order to show the different aspects of rome sort of an overview of rome and the plan that you might see from a dirigible quick snapshots of things you might see from a speeding motor scooter and very slow walking through rome you might be able to study in more detail some of the wonderful surfaces and whatnot that you come across anyways i went back to the dirigible notion went to alberto santos-dumont found one of his dirigibles that had enough dimensions so i could actually use it as a scale that i would then juxtapose with some of the things in rome this thing would be flying over or past or be parked in front of but it would be like having a ruler [UNK] sort of travel through the pages without being a ruler not that you know how long number 11 actually is but you would be able to compare number 11 against the pantheon with number 11 against the baths of caracalla and so on and so forth if you were interested this is beatrix she has a dog named ajax she has purchased a dirigible [UNK] a small dirigible [UNK] she 's assembling the structure ajax is sniffing for holes in the balloon before they set off she launches this thing above the spanish steps and sets off for an aerial tour of the city over the spanish steps we go a nice way to show that river that stream sort of pouring down the hill unfortunately just across the road from it or quite close by is the column of marcus aurelius and the diameter of the dirigible makes an impression as you can see as she starts trying to read the story that spirals around the column of marcus aurelius [UNK] gets a little too close nudges it this gives me a chance to suggest to you the structure of the column of marcus aurelius which is really no more than a pile of quarters high [UNK] thick quarters over the piazza of saint ignacio completely ruining the symmetry but that aside a spectacular place to visit a spectacular framework inside of which you see usually extraordinary blue sky over the pantheon and the 26-foot diameter oculus she parks her dirigible lowers the anchor rope and climbs down for a closer look inside the text here is right side and upside down so that you are forced to turn the book around and you can see it from ground point of view and from her point of view [UNK] looking in the hole getting a different kind of perspective moving you around the space particularly appropriate in a building that can contain perfectly a sphere dimensions of the diameter being the same as the distance from the center of the floor to the center of the oculus unfortunately for her the anchor line gets tangled around the feet of some boy scouts who are visiting the pantheon and they are immediately yanked out and given an extraordinary but terrifying tour of some of the domes of rome which would from their point of view naturally be hanging upside down they bail out as soon as they get to the top of saint ivo that little spiral structure you see there she continues on her way over piazza navona notices a lot of activity at the tre scalini restaurant is reminded that it is lunchtime and she 's hungry they keep on motoring towards the campo de ' fiori which they soon reach ajax the dog is put in a basket and lowered with a list of food into the marketplace which flourishes there until about one in the afternoon and then is completely removed and does n't appear again until six or seven the following morning anyway the pooch gets back to the dirigible with the stuff unfortunately when she goes to unwrap the prosciutto ajax makes a lunge for it she 's managed to save the prosciutto but in the process she loses the tablecloth which you can see flying away in the upper left-hand corner they continue without their tablecloth looking for a place to land this thing so that they can actually have lunch they eventually discover a huge wall that 's filled with small holes ideal for docking a dirigible because you 've got a place to tie up turns out to be the exterior wall [UNK] that part of it that remains [UNK] of the coliseum so they park themselves there and have a terrific lunch and have a spectacular view at the end of lunch they untie the anchor they set off through the baths of caracalla and over the walls of the city and then an abandoned gatehouse and decide to take one more look at the pyramid of cestius which has this lightning rod on top unfortunately that 's a problem they get a little too close and when you 're in a dirigible you have to be very careful about spikes so that sort of brings her little story to a conclusion marcello on the other hand is sort of a lazy guy but he 's not due at work until about noon so the alarm goes off and it 's five to 12 or so he gets up leaps onto his scooter races through the city past the church of santa maria della pace down the alleys through the streets that tourists may be wandering through disturbing the quiet backstreet life of rome at every turn that speed with which he is moving i hope i have suggested in this little image which again can be turned around and read from both sides because there 's text on the bottom and text on the top one of which is upside down in this image so he keeps on moving approaching an unsuspecting waiter who is trying to deliver two plates of linguine in a delicate white wine clam sauce to diners who are sitting at a table just outside of a restaurant in the street waiter catches on but it 's too late and marcello keeps moving in his scooter everything he sees from this point on is slightly affected by the linguine but keeps on moving because this guy 's got a job to do removes some scaffolding one of the reasons rome remains the extraordinary place it is that because of scaffolding and the determination to maintain the fabric it is a city that continues to grow and adapt to the needs of the particular time in which it finds itself or we find it right through the piazza della rotonda in front of the pantheon [UNK] again wreaking havoc [UNK] and finally getting to work marcello as it turns out is the driver of the number 64 bus and if you 've been on the number 64 bus you know that it 's driven with the same kind of exuberance as marcello demonstrated on his scooter and finally carletto you see his apartment in the upper left-hand corner he 's looking at his table he 's planning to propose this evening to his girlfriend of 40 years and he wants it to be perfect he 's got candles out he 's got flowers in the middle and he 's trying to figure out where to put the plates and the glasses but he 's not happy something 's wrong the phone rings anyway he 's called to the palazzo he saunters [UNK] he saunters at a good clip but as compared to all the traveling we 've just seen he 's sauntering everybody knows carletto because he 's in entertainment actually he 's in television he 's actually in television repair which is why people know him so they all have his number he arrives at the palazzo arrives at the big front door enters the courtyard and talks to the custodian who tells him that there 's been a disaster in the palazzo nobody 's tvs are working and there 's a big soccer game coming up and the crowd is getting a little restless and a little nervous he goes down to the basement and starts to check the wiring and then gradually works his way up to the top of the building apartment by apartment checking every television checking every connection hoping to find out what this problem is he works his way up finally the grand staircase and then a smaller staircase until he reaches the attic he opens the window of the attic of course and there 's a tablecloth wrapped around the building 's television antenna he removes it the problems are solved everybody in the palazzo is happy and of course he also solves his own problem all he has to do now with a perfect table is wait for her to arrive that was the first attempt but it did n't seem substantial enough to convey whatever it was i wanted to convey about rome so i thought well i 'll just do piazzas and i 'll get inside and underneath and i 'll show these things growing and show why they 're shaped the way they are and so on and then i thought that 's too complicated no i 'll just take my favorite bits and pieces and i 'll put them inside the pantheon but keep the scale so you can see the top of sant'ivo and the pyramid of cestius and the tempietto of bramante all side by side in this amazing space now that 's one drawing so i thought maybe it 's time for piranesi to meet escher you see that i 'm beginning to really lose control here and also hope there 's a very thin blue line of exhaust that sort of runs through this thing that would be kind of the trail that holds it all together then i thought " wait a minute what am i doing " a book is not only a neat way of collecting and storing information it 's a series of layers i mean you always peel one layer off another we think of them as pages doing it a certain way but think of them as layers i mean rome is a place of layers [UNK] horizontal layers vertical layers [UNK] and i thought well just peeling off a page would allow me to [UNK] if i got you thinking about it the right way [UNK] would allow me to sort of show you the depth of layers the stucco on the walls of most of the buildings in rome covers the scars the scars of centuries of change as these structures have been adapted rather than being torn down if i do a foldout page on the left-hand side and let you just unfold it you see behind it what i mean by scar tissue you can see that in 1635 it became essential to make smaller windows because the bad guys were coming or whatever adaptations all get buried under the stucco i could peel out a page of this palazzo to show you what 's going on inside of it but more importantly i could also show you what it looks like at the corner of one of those magnificent buildings with all the massive stone blocks or the fake stone blocks done with brick and stucco which is more often the case so it becomes slightly three-dimensional i could take you down one of those narrow little streets into one of those surprising piazzas by using a double gate fold [UNK] double foldout page [UNK] which if you were like me reading a pop-up book as a child you hopefully stick your head into you wrap the pages around your head and are in that piazza for that brief period of time and i 've really not done anything much more complicated than make foldout pages but then i thought maybe i could be simpler here let 's look at the pantheon and the piazza della rotonda in front of it here 's a book completely wide open ok if i do n't open the book the whole way if i just open it 90 degrees we 're looking down the front of the pantheon and we 're looking sort of at the top more or less down on the square and if i turn the book the other way we 're looking across the square at the front of the pantheon no foldouts no tricks [UNK] just a book that is n't open the whole way that seemed promising i thought maybe i 'll do it inside and i can even combine the foldouts with the only partially opened book so we get inside the pantheon and it grows and so on and so forth and i thought maybe i 'm on the right track but it sort of lost its human quality so i went back to the notion of story which is always a good thing to have if you 're trying to get people to pay attention to a book and pick up information along the way " pigeon 's progress " struck me as a catchy title if it was a homing pigeon it would be called " homer 's odyssey " but it was the journey of the 1 i mean if a title works use it but it would be a journey that went through rome and showed all the things that i like about rome it 's a pigeon sitting on top of a church goes off during the day and does normal pigeon stuff comes back the whole place is covered with scaffolding and green netting and there 's no way this pigeon can get home so it 's a homeless pigeon now and it 's going to have to find another place to live and that allows me to go through my catalog of favorite things and we start with the tall ones and so on maybe it has to go back and live with family members that 's not always a good thing but it does sort of bring pigeons together again and i thought that 's sort of interesting but maybe there 's a person who should be involved in this in some way so i kind of came up with this old guy who spends his life looking after sick pigeons he 'll go anywhere to get them [UNK] dangerous places and whatnot [UNK] and they become really friends with this guy and learn to do tricks for him and entertain him at lunchtime and stuff like that there 's a real bond that develops between this old man and these pigeons but unfortunately he gets sick he gets really sick at the end of the story he 's taught them to spell his name which is aldo they show up one day after three or four days of not seeing him [UNK] he lives in this little garret [UNK] and they spell his name and fly around and he finally gets enough strength together to climb up the ladder onto the roof and all the pigeons a la red balloon are there waiting for him and they carry him off over the walls of the city and i forgot to mention this whenever he lost a pigeon he would take that pigeon out beyond the walls of the city in the old roman custom the dead were never buried within the walls and i thought that 's a really cheery story that 's really going to go a long way so anyway i went through 1 and again if packaging does n't work and if the stories are n't going anywhere i just come up with titles and hope that a title will sort of kick me off in the right direction and sometimes it does focus me enough and i 'll even do a title page so these are all title pages that eventually led me to the solution i settled on which is the story of a young woman who sends a message on a homing pigeon [UNK] she lives outside the walls of the city of rome [UNK] to someone in the city and the pigeon is flying down above the appian way here you can see the tombs and pines and so on and so forth along the way if you see the red line you are seeing the trail of the pigeon if you do n't see the red line you are the pigeon and it becomes necessary and possible at this point to try to convey what that sense would be like of flying over the city without actually moving past the pyramid of cestius [UNK] these will seem very familiar to you even if you have n't been to rome recently [UNK] past the gatehouse this is something that 's a little bit unusual this pigeon does something that most homing pigeons do not do it takes the scenic route which was a device that i felt was necessary to actually extend this book beyond about four pages so we circle around the coliseum past the church of santa maria in cosmedin and the temple of hercules towards the river we almost collide with the cornice of the palazzo farnese [UNK] designed by michelangelo built of stone taken from the coliseum [UNK] narrow escape we swoop down over the campo de ' fiori this is one of those things i show to my students because it 's a complete bastardization [UNK] a denial of any rules of perspective the only rule of perspective that i think matters is if it looks believable you 've succeeded but you try and figure out where the vanishing points meet here a couple are on mars and a couple of others in cremona but into the piazza in front of santa maria della pace where invariably a soccer game is going on and we 're hit by a soccer ball now this is a terrible illustration of being hit by a soccer ball i have all the pieces there 's santa maria della pace there 's a soccer ball there 's a little bit of a bird 's wing [UNK] nothing 's happening so i had to rethink it and if you do want to see santa maria della pace these books are really flexible incredibly interactive [UNK] just turn it around and look at it the other way through the alley we can see the impact is captured in the red line and then bird manages to pull itself together past this medieval tower [UNK] one of the few remaining medieval towers [UNK] towards the church of sant'agnese and around the dome looking down into piazza navona [UNK] which we 've already mentioned and seen and flown over a couple of times there 's the bernini statue of the four rivers [UNK] and then past the wonderful borromini sant'ivo stopping just long enough on the 26-foot diameter oculus of the pantheon to catch our breath and then we can swoop inside and around and because we 're flying we do n't really have to worry about gravity at this particular moment in time so this drawing can be oriented in any way on the page we get a little exuberant as we pass gesu it 's not surprising to sort of mimic the architecture in this way past the wonderful wall filled with the juxtaposition that i was talking about beautiful carvings set into the walls above the neon " ristorante " sign and so on and eventually we arrive at the courtyard of the palazzo which is our destination straight up through the courtyard into a little window into the attic where somebody is working at the drawing board he removes the message from the leg of the bird this is what it says as we look at the drawing board we see what he 's working on is in fact a map of the journey that the pigeon has just taken and the red line extends through all the sights and if you want the information so that we complete this cycle of understanding all you have to do is read these paragraphs thank you very much .something called the danish twin study established that only about 10 percent of how long the average person lives within certain biological limits is dictated by our genes the other 90 percent is dictated by our lifestyle so the premise of blue zones if we can find the optimal lifestyle of longevity we can come up with a de facto formula for longevity but if you ask the average american what the optimal formula of longevity is they probably could n't tell you they 've probably heard of the south beach diet or the atkins diet you have the usda food pyramid there is what oprah tells us there is what doctor oz tells us the fact of the matter is there is a lot of confusion around what really helps us live longer better should you be running marathons or doing yoga should you eat organic meats or should you be eating tofu when it comes to supplements should you be taking them how about these hormones or resveratrol and does purpose play into it spirituality and how about how we socialize well our approach to finding longevity was to team up with national geographic and the national institute on aging to find the four demographically confirmed areas that are geographically defined and then bring a team of experts in there to methodically go through exactly what these people do to distill down the cross-cultural distillation and at the end of this i 'm going to tell you what that distillation is but first i 'd like to debunk some common myths when it comes to longevity and the first myth is if you try really hard you can live to be 100 false the problem is only about one out of 5,000 people in america live to be 100 your chances are very low even though it 's the fastest growing demographic in america it 's hard to reach 100 the problem is that we 're not programmed for longevity we are programmed for something called procreative success i love that word it reminds me of my college days biologists term procreative success to mean the age where you have children and then another generation the age when your children have children after that the effect of evolution completely dissipates if you 're a mammal if you 're a rat or an elephant or a human in between it 's the same story so to make it to age 100 you not only have to have had a very good lifestyle you also have to have won the genetic lottery the second myth is there are treatments that can help slow reverse or even stop aging false when you think of it there is 99 things that can age us deprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes those brain cells die they never come back play tennis too hard on your knees ruin your cartilage the cartilage never comes back our arteries can clog our brains can gunk up with plaque and we can get alzheimer 's there is just too many things to go wrong our bodies have 35 trillion cells trillion with a " t. " we 're talking national debt numbers here those cells turn themselves over once every eight years and every time they turn themselves over there is some damage and that damage builds up and it builds up exponentially it 's a little bit like the days when we all had beatles albums or eagles albums and we 'd make a copy of that on a cassette tape and let our friends copy that cassette tape and pretty soon with successive generations that tape sounds like garbage well the same things happen to our cells that 's why a 65-year-old person is aging at a rate of about 125 times faster than a 12-year-old person so if there is nothing you can do to slow your aging or stop your aging what am i doing here well the fact of the matter is the best science tells us that the capacity of the human body my body your body is about 90 years a little bit more for women but life expectancy in this country is only 78 so somewhere along the line we 're leaving about 12 good years on the table these are years that we could get and research shows that they would be years largely free of chronic disease heart disease cancer and diabetes we think the best way to get these missing years is to look at the cultures around the world that are actually experiencing them areas where people are living to age 100 at rates up to 10 times greater than we are areas where the life expectancy is an extra dozen years the rate of middle age mortality is a fraction of what it is in this country we found our first blue zone about 125 miles off the coast of italy on the island of sardinia and not the entire island the island is about 1.4 million people but only up in the highlands an area called the nuoro province and here we have this area where men live the longest about 10 times more centenarians than we have here in america and this is a place where people not only reach age 100 they do so with extraordinary vigor places where 102 year olds still ride their bike to work chop wood and can beat a guy 60 years younger than them their history actually goes back to about the time of christ it 's actually a bronze age culture that 's been isolated because the land is so infertile they largely are shepherds which occasions regular low-intensity physical activity their diet is mostly plant-based accentuated with foods that they can carry into the fields they came up with an unleavened whole wheat bread called carta musica made out of durum wheat a type of cheese made from grass-fed animals so the cheese is high in omega-3 fatty acids instead of omega-6 fatty acids from corn-fed animals and a type of wine that has three times the level of polyphenols than any known wine in the world it 's called cannonau but the real secret i think lies more in the way that they organize their society and one of the most salient elements of the sardinian society is how they treat older people you ever notice here in america social equity seems to peak at about age 24 just look at the advertisements here in sardinia the older you get the more equity you have the more wisdom you 're celebrated for you go into the bars in sardinia instead of seeing the sports illustrated swimsuit calendar you see the centenarian of the month calendar this as it turns out is not only good for your aging parents to keep them close to the family [UNK] it imparts about four to six years of extra life expectancy [UNK] research shows it 's also good for the children of those families who have lower rates of mortality and lower rates of disease that 's called the grandmother effect we found our second blue zone on the other side of the planet about 800 miles south of tokyo on the archipelago of okinawa okinawa is actually 161 small islands and in the northern part of the main island this is ground zero for world longevity this is a place where the oldest living female population is found it 's a place where people have the longest disability-free life expectancy in the world they have what we want they live a long time and tend to die in their sleep very quickly and often i can tell you after sex they live about seven good years longer than the average american five times as many centenarians as we have in america one fifth the rate of colon and breast cancer big killers here in america and one sixth the rate of cardiovascular disease and the fact that this culture has yielded these numbers suggests strongly they have something to teach us what do they do once again a plant-based diet full of vegetables with lots of color in them and they eat about eight times as much tofu as americans do more significant than what they eat is how they eat it they have all kinds of little strategies to keep from overeating which as you know is a big problem here in america a few of the strategies we observed they eat off of smaller plates so they tend to eat fewer calories at every sitting instead of serving family style where you can sort of mindlessly eat as you 're talking they serve at the counter put the food away and then bring it to the table they also have a 3,000-year-old adage which i think is the greatest sort of diet suggestion ever invented it was invented by confucius and that diet is known as the hara hatchi bu diet it 's simply a little saying these people say before their meal to remind them to stop eating when their stomach is [ 80 ] percent full it takes about a half hour for that full feeling to travel from your belly to your brain and by remembering to stop at 80 percent it helps keep you from doing that very thing but like sardinia okinawa has a few social constructs that we can associate with longevity we know that isolation kills fifteen years ago the average american had three good friends we 're down to one and half right now if you were lucky enough to be born in okinawa you were born into a system where you automatically have a half a dozen friends with whom you travel through life they call it a moai and if you 're in a moai you 're expected to share the bounty if you encounter luck and if things go bad child gets sick parent dies you always have somebody who has your back this particular moai these five ladies have been together for 97 years their average age is 102 typically in america we 've divided our adult life up into two sections there is our work life where we 're productive and then one day boom we retire and typically that has meant retiring to the easy chair or going down to arizona to play golf in the okinawan language there is not even a word for retirement instead there is one word that imbues your entire life and that word is " ikigai " and roughly translated it means " the reason for which you wake up in the morning " for this 102-year-old karate master his ikigai was carrying forth this martial art for this hundred-year-old fisherman it was continuing to catch fish for his family three times a week and this is a question the national institute on aging actually gave us a questionnaire to give these centenarians and one of the questions they were very culturally astute the people who put the questionnaire one of the questions was " what is your ikigai " they instantly knew why they woke up in the morning for this 102 year old woman her ikigai was simply her great-great-great-granddaughter two girls separated in age by 101 and a half years and i asked her what it felt like to hold a great-great-great-granddaughter and she put her head back and she said " it feels like leaping into heaven " i thought that was a wonderful thought my editor at geographic wanted me to find america 's blue zone and for a while we looked on the prairies of minnesota where actually there is a very high proportion of centenarians but that 's because all the young people left so we turned to the data again and we found america 's longest-lived population among the seventh-day adventists concentrated in and around loma linda california adventists are conservative methodists they celebrate their sabbath from sunset on friday till sunset on saturday a " 24-hour sanctuary in time " they call it and they follow five little habits that conveys to them extraordinary longevity comparatively speaking in america here life expectancy for the average woman is 80 but for an adventist woman their life expectancy is 89 and the difference is even more pronounced among men who are expected to live about 11 years longer than their american counterparts now this is a study that followed about 70,000 people for 30 years sterling study and i think it supremely illustrates the premise of this blue zone project this is a heterogeneous community it 's white black hispanic asian the only thing that they have in common are a set of very small lifestyle habits that they follow ritualistically for most of their lives they take their diet directly from the bible genesis chapter one verse [ 29 ] where god talks about legumes and seeds and on one more stanza about green plants ostensibly missing is meat they take this sanctuary in time very serious for 24 hours every week no matter how busy they are how stressed out they are at work where the kids need to be driven they stop everything and they focus on their god their social network and then hardwired right in the religion are nature walks and the power of this is not that it 's done occasionally the power is it 's done every week for a lifetime none of it 's hard none of it costs money adventists also tend to hang out with other adventists so if you go to an adventist 's party you do n't see people swilling jim beam or rolling a joint instead they 're talking about their next nature walk exchanging recipes and yes they pray but they influence each other in profound and measurable ways this is a culture that has yielded ellsworth whareham ellsworth whareham is 97 years old he 's a multimillionaire yet when a contractor wanted 6,000 dollars to build a privacy fence he said " for that kind of money i 'll do it myself " so for the next three days he was out shoveling cement and hauling poles around and predictably perhaps on the fourth day he ended up in the operating room but not as the guy on the table the guy doing open-heart surgery at 97 he still does 20 open-heart surgeries every month ed rawlings 103 years old now an active cowboy starts his morning with a swim and on weekends he likes to put on the boards throw up rooster tails and then marge deton marge is 104 her grandson actually lives in the twin cities here she starts her day with lifting weights she rides her bicycle and then she gets in her root-beer colored 1994 cadillac seville and tears down the san bernardino freeway where she still volunteers for seven different organizations i 've been on 19 hardcore expeditions i 'm probably the only person you 'll ever meet who rode his bicycle across the sahara desert without sunscreen but i 'll tell you there is no adventure more harrowing than riding shotgun with marge deton " a stranger is a friend i have n't met yet 1 " she 'd say to me so what are the common denominators in these three cultures what are the things that they all do and we managed to boil it down to nine in fact we 've done two more blue zone expeditions since this and these common denominators hold true and the first one and i 'm about to utter a heresy here none of them exercise at least the way we think of exercise instead they set up their lives so that they are constantly nudged into physical activity these 100-year-old okinawan women are getting up and down off the ground they sit on the floor 30 or 40 times a day sardinians live in vertical houses up and down the stairs every trip to the store or to church or to a friend 's house occasions a walk they do n't have any conveniences there is not a button to push to do yard work or house work if they want to mix up a cake they 're doing it by hand that 's physical activity that burns calories just as much as going on the treadmill does when they do do intentional physical activity it 's the things they enjoy they tend to walk the only proven way to stave off cognitive decline and they all tend to have a garden they know how to set up their life in the right way so they have the right outlook each of these cultures take time to downshift the sardinians pray the seventh-day adventists pray the okinawans have this ancestor veneration but when you 're in a hurry or stressed out that triggers something called the inflammatory response which is associated with everything from alzheimer 's disease to cardiovascular disease when you slow down for 15 minutes a day you turn that inflammatory state into a more anti-inflammatory state they have vocabulary for sense of purpose ikigai like the okinawans you know the two most dangerous years in your life are the year you 're born because of infant mortality and the year you retire these people know their sense of purpose and they activate in their life that 's worth about seven years of extra life expectancy there 's no longevity diet instead these people drink a little bit every day not a hard sell to the american population they tend to eat a plant-based diet does n't mean they do n't eat meat but lots of beans and nuts and they have strategies to keep from overeating little things that nudge them away from the table at the right time and then the foundation of all this is how they connect they put their families first take care of their children and their aging parents they all tend to belong to a faith-based community which is worth between four and 14 extra years of life expectancy if you do it four times a month and the biggest thing here is they also belong to the right tribe they were either born into or they proactively surrounded themselves with the right people we know from the framingham studies that if your three best friends are obese there is a 50 percent better chance that you 'll be overweight so if you hang out with unhealthy people that 's going to have a measurable impact over time instead if your friend 's idea of recreation is physical activity bowling or playing hockey biking or gardening if your friends drink a little but not too much and they eat right and they 're engaged and they 're trusting and trustworthy that is going to have the biggest impact over time diets do n't work no diet in the history of the world has ever worked for more than two percent of the population exercise programs usually start in january they 're usually done by october when it comes to longevity there is no short term fix in a pill or anything else but when you think about it your friends are long-term adventures and therefore perhaps the most significant thing you can do to add more years to your life and life to your years thank you very much .i just did something i 've never done before i spent a week at sea on a research vessel now i 'm not a scientist but i was accompanying a remarkable scientific team from the university of south florida who have been tracking the travels of bp 's oil in the gulf of mexico this is the boat we were on by the way the scientists i was with were not studying the effect of the oil and dispersants on the big stuff [UNK] the birds the turtles the dolphins the glamorous stuff they 're looking at the really little stuff that gets eaten by the slightly less little stuff that eventually gets eaten by the big stuff and what they 're finding is that even trace amounts of oil and dispersants can be highly toxic to phytoplankton which is very bad news because so much life depends on it so contrary to what we heard a few months back about how 75 percent of that oil sort of magically disappeared and we did n't have to worry about it this disaster is still unfolding it 's still working its way up the food chain now this should n't come as a surprise to us rachel carson [UNK] the godmother of modern environmentalism [UNK] warned us about this very thing back in 1962 she pointed out that the " control men " [UNK] as she called them [UNK] who carpet-bombed towns and fields with toxic insecticides like ddt were only trying to kill the little stuff the insects not the birds but they forgot this the fact that birds dine on grubs that robins eat lots of worms now saturated with ddt and so robin eggs failed to hatch songbirds died en masse towns fell silent thus the title " silent spring " i 've been trying to pinpoint what keeps drawing me back to the gulf of mexico because i 'm canadian and i can draw no ancestral ties and i think what it is is i do n't think we have fully come to terms with the meaning of this disaster with what it meant to witness a hole ripped in our world with what it meant to watch the contents of the earth gush forth on live tv 24 hours a day for months after telling ourselves for so long that our tools and technology can control nature suddenly we were face-to-face with our weakness with our lack of control as the oil burst out of every attempt to contain it [UNK] " top hats " " top kills " and most memorably the " junk shot " [UNK] the bright idea of firing old tires and golf balls down that hole in the world but even more striking than the ferocious power emanating from that well was the recklessness with which that power was unleashed [UNK] the carelessness the lack of planning that characterized the operation from drilling to clean-up if there is one thing bp 's watery improv act made clear it is that as a culture we have become far too willing to gamble with things that are precious and irreplaceable and to do so without a back-up plan without an exit strategy and bp was hardly our first experience of this in recent years our leaders barrel into wars telling themselves happy stories about cakewalks and welcome parades then it is years of deadly damage control frankensteins of sieges and surges and counter-insurgencies and once again no exit strategy our financial wizards routinely fall victim to similar overconfidence convincing themselves that the latest bubble is a new kind of market [UNK] the kind that never goes down and when it inevitably does the best and the brightest reach for the financial equivalent of the junk shot [UNK] in this case throwing massive amounts of much-needed public money down a very different kind of hole as with bp the hole does get plugged at least temporarily but not before exacting a tremendous price we have to figure out why we keep letting this happen because we are in the midst of what may be our highest-stakes gamble of all [UNK] deciding what to do or not to do about climate change now as you know a great deal of time is spent in this country and around the world inside the climate debate on the question of " what if the ipc scientists are all wrong " now a far more relevant question [UNK] as mit physicist evelyn fox keller puts it [UNK] is " what if those scientists are right " given the stakes the climate crisis clearly calls for us to act based on the precautionary principle [UNK] the theory that holds that when human health and the environment are significantly at risk and when the potential damage is irreversible we can not afford to wait for perfect scientific certainty better to err on the side of caution more overt the burden of proving that a practice is safe should not be placed on the public that would be harmed but rather on the industry that stands to profit but climate policy in the wealthy world [UNK] to the extent that such a thing exists [UNK] is not based on precaution but rather on cost-benefit analysis [UNK] finding the course of action that economists believe will have the least impact on our gdp so rather than asking as precaution would demand what can we do as quickly as possible to avoid potential catastrophe we ask bizarre questions like this " what is the latest possible moment we can wait before we begin seriously lowering emissions can we put this off till 2020 2030 2050 " or we ask " how much hotter can we let the planet get and still survive can we go with two degrees three degrees or [UNK] where we 're currently going [UNK] four degrees celsius " and by the way the assumption that we can safely control the earth 's awesomely complex climate system as if it had a thermostat making the planet not too hot not too cold but just right [UNK] sort of goldilocks style [UNK] this is pure fantasy and it 's not coming from the climate scientists it 's coming from the economists imposing their mechanistic thinking on the science the fact is that we simply do n't know when the warming that we create will be utterly overwhelmed by feedback loops so once again why do we take these crazy risks with the precious a range of explanations may be popping into your mind by now like " greed " this is a popular explanation and there 's lots of truth to it because taking big risks as we all know pays a lot of money another explanation that you often hear for recklessness is hubris and greed and hubris are intimately intertwined when it comes to recklessness for instance if you happen to be a 35-year-old banker taking home 100 times more than a brain surgeon then you need a narrative you need a story that makes that disparity okay and you actually do n't have a lot of options you 're either an incredibly good scammer and you 're getting away with it [UNK] you gamed the system [UNK] or you 're some kind of boy genius the likes of which the world has never seen now both of these options [UNK] the boy genius and the scammer [UNK] are going to make you vastly overconfident and therefore more prone to taking even bigger risks in the future by the way tony hayward the former ceo of bp had a plaque on his desk inscribed with this inspirational slogan " what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail " now this is actually a popular plaque and this is a crowd of overachievers so i 'm betting that some of you have this plaque do n't feel ashamed putting fear of failure out of your mind can be a very good thing if you 're training for a triathlon or preparing to give a tedtalk but personally i think people with the power to detonate our economy and ravage our ecology would do better having a picture of icarus hanging from the wall because [UNK] maybe not that one in particular [UNK] but i want them thinking about the possibility of failure all of the time so we have greed we 've got overconfidencehubris but since we 're here at tedwomen let 's consider one other factor that could be contributing in some small way to societal recklessness now i 'm not going to belabor this point but studies do show that as investors women are much less prone to taking reckless risks than men precisely because as we 've already heard women tend not to suffer from overconfidence in the same way that men do so it turns out that being paid less and praised less has its upsides [UNK] for society at least the flipside of this is that constantly being told that you are gifted chosen and born to rule has distinct societal downsides and this problem [UNK] call it the " perils of privilege " [UNK] brings us closer i think to the root of our collective recklessness because none of us [UNK] at least in the global north [UNK] neither men nor women are fully exempt from this message here 's what i 'm talking about whether we actively believe them or consciously reject them our culture remains in the grips of certain archetypal stories about our supremacy over others and over nature [UNK] the narrative of the newly discovered frontier and the conquering pioneer the narrative of manifest destiny the narrative of apocalypse and salvation and just when you think these stories are fading into history and that we 've gotten over them they pop up in the strangest places for instance i stumbled across this advertisement outside the women 's washroom in the kansas city airport it 's for motorola 's new rugged cell phone and yes it really does say " slap mother nature in the face " and i 'm not just showing it to pick on motorola [UNK] that 's just a bonus i 'm showing it because [UNK] they 're not a sponsor are they [UNK] because in its own way this is a crass version of our founding story we slapped mother nature around and won and we always win because dominating nature is our destiny but this is not the only fairytale we tell ourselves about nature there 's another one equally important about how that very same mother nature is so nurturing and so resilient that we can never make a dent in her abundance let 's hear from tony hayward again " the gulf of mexico is a very big ocean the amount of oil and dispersants that we are putting into it is tiny in relation to the total water volume " in other words the ocean is big she can take it it is this underlying assumption of limitlessness that makes it possible to take the reckless risks that we do because this is our real master-narrative however much we mess up there will always be more [UNK] more water more land more untapped resources a new bubble will replace the old one a new technology will come along to fix the messes we made with the last one in a way that is the story of the settling of the americas the supposedly inexhaustible frontier to which europeans escaped and it 's also the story of modern capitalism because it was the wealth from this land that gave birth to our economic system one that can not survive without perpetual growth and an unending supply of new frontiers now the problem is that the story was always a lie the earth always did have limits they were just beyond our sights and now we are hitting those limits on multiple fronts i believe that we know this yet we find ourselves trapped in a kind of narrative loop not only do we continue to tell and retell the same tired stories but we are now doing so with a frenzy and a fury that frankly verges on camp how else to explain the cultural space occupied by sarah palin now on the one hand exhorting us to " drill baby drill " because god put those resources into the ground in order for us to exploit them and on the other glorying in the wilderness of alaska 's untouched beauty on her hit reality tv show the twin message is as comforting as it is mad ignore those creeping fears that we have finally hit the wall there are still no limits there will always be another frontier so stop worrying and keep shopping now would that this were just about sarah palin and her reality tv show in environmental circles we often hear that rather than shifting to renewables we are continuing with business as usual this assessment unfortunately is far too optimistic the truth is that we have already exhausted so much of the easily accessible fossil fuels that we have already entered a far riskier business era the era of extreme energy so that means drilling for oil in the deepest water including the icy arctic seas where a clean-up may simply be impossible it means large-scale hydraulic fracking for gas and massive strip-mining operations for coal the likes of which we have n't yet seen and most controversially it means the tar sands i 'm always surprised by how little people outside of canada know about the alberta tar sands which this year are projected to become the number one source of imported oil to the united states it 's worth taking a moment to understand this practice because i believe it speaks to recklessness and the path we 're on like little else so this is where the tar sands live under one of the last magnificent boreal forests the oil is not liquid you ca n't just drill a hole and pump it out tar sand 's oil is solid mixed in with the soil so to get at it you first have to get rid of the trees then you rip off the topsoil and get at that oily sand the process requires a huge amount of water which is then pumped into massive toxic tailing ponds that 's very bad news for local indigenous people living downstream who are reporting alarmingly high cancer rates now looking at these images it 's difficult to grasp the scale of this operation which can already be seen from space and could grow to an area the size of england i find it helps actually to look at the dump trucks that move the earth the largest ever built that 's a person down there by the wheel my point is that this is not oil drilling it 's not even mining it is terrestrial skinning vast vivid landscapes are being gutted left monochromatic gray now i should confess that as [ far as ] i 'm concerned this would be an abomination if it emitted not one particle of carbon but the truth is that on average turning that gunk into crude oil produces about three times more greenhouse gas pollution than it does to produce conventional oil in canada how else to describe this but as a form of mass insanity just when we know we need to be learning to live on the surface of our planet off the power of sun wind and waves we are frantically digging to get at the dirtiest highest-emitting stuff imaginable this is where our story of endless growth has taken us to this black hole at the center of my country [UNK] a place of such planetary pain that like the bp gusher one can only stand to look at it for so long as jared diamond and others have shown us this is how civilizations commit suicide by slamming their foot on the accelerator at the exact moment when they should be putting on the brakes the problem is that our master-narrative has an answer for that too at the very last minute we are going to get saved just like in every hollywood movie just like in the rapture but of course our secular religion is technology now you may have noticed more and more headlines like these the idea behind this form of " geoengineering " as it 's called is that as the planet heats up we may be able to shoot sulfates and aluminum particles into the stratosphere to reflect some of the sun 's rays back to space thereby cooling the planet the wackiest plan [UNK] and i 'm not making this up [UNK] would put what is essentially a garden hose 18-and-a-half miles high into the sky suspended by balloons to spew sulfur dioxide so solving the problem of pollution with more pollution think of it as the ultimate junk shot the serious scientists involved in this research all stress that these techniques are entirely untested they do n't know if they 'll work and they have no idea what kind of terrifying side effects they could unleash nevertheless the mere mention of geoengineering is being greeted in some circles particularly media circles with a relief tinged with euphoria an escape hatch has been reached a new frontier has been found most importantly we do n't have to change our lifestyles after all you see for some people their savior is a guy in a flowing robe for other people it 's a guy with a garden hose we badly need some new stories we need stories that have different kinds of heroes willing to take different kinds of risks [UNK] risks that confront recklessness head on that put the precautionary principle into practice even if that means through direct action [UNK] like hundreds of young people willing to get arrested blocking dirty power plants or fighting mountaintop-removal coal mining we need stories that replace that linear narrative of endless growth with circular narratives that remind us that what goes around comes around that this is our only home there is no escape hatch call it karma call it physics action and reaction call it precaution [UNK] the principle that reminds us that life is too precious to be risked for any profit thank you .now when we think of our senses we do n't usually think of the reasons why they probably evolved from a biological perspective we do n't really think of the evolutionary need to be protected by our senses but that 's probably why our senses really evolved [UNK] to keep us safe to allow us to live really when we think of our senses or when we think of the loss of the sense we really think about something more like this the ability to touch something luxurious to taste something delicious to smell something fragrant to see something beautiful this is what we want out of our senses we want beauty we do n't just want function and when it comes to sensory restoration we 're still very far away from being able to provide beauty and that 's what i 'd like to talk to you a little bit about today likewise for hearing when we think about why we hear we do n't often think about the ability to hear an alarm or a siren although clearly that 's an important thing really what we want to hear is music so many of you know that that 's beethoven 's seventh symphony many of you know that he was deaf or near profoundly deaf when he wrote that how unusual it is that we can hear music music is just one of the strangest things that there is it 's acoustic vibrations in the air little waves of energy in the air that tickle our eardrum somehow in tickling our eardrum that transmits energy down our hearing bones which get converted to a fluid impulse inside the cochlea and then somehow converted into an electrical signal in our auditory nerves that somehow wind up in our brains as a perception of a song or a beautiful piece of music that process is entirely abstract and very very unusual and we could discuss that topic alone for days to really try to figure out how is it that we hear something that 's emotional from something that starts out as a vibration in the air turns out that if you have hearing loss most people that lose their hearing lose it at what 's called the cochlea the inner ear and it 's at the hair cell level that they do this now if you had to pick a sense to lose i have to be very honest with you and say we 're better at restoring hearing than we are at restoring any sense that there is in fact nothing even actually comes close to our ability to restore hearing and as a physician and a surgeon i can confidently tell my patients that if you had to pick a sense to lose we are the furthest along medically and surgically with hearing as a musician i can tell you that if i had to have a cochlear implant i 'd be heartbroken i 'd just be plainly heartbroken because i know that music would never sound the same to me now this is a video that i 'm going to show you of a girl who 's born deaf she 's in a very supportive environment her mother 's doing everything she can okay play that video please mother that 's an owl owl yeah owl owl yeah baby baby you want it charles limb now despite everything going for this child in terms of family support and simple infused learning there is a limitation to what a child who 's deaf an infant who was born deaf has in this world in terms of social educational vocational opportunities i 'm not saying that they ca n't live a beautiful wonderful life i 'm saying that they 're going to face obstacles that most people who have normal hearing will not have to face now hearing loss and the treatment for hearing loss has really evolved in the past 200 years i mean literally they used to do things like stick ear-shaped objects onto your ears and stick funnels in and that was the best you could do for hearing loss back then you could n't even look at the eardrum so it 's not too surprising that there were no good treatments for hearing loss and now today we have the modern multi-channel cochlear implant which is an outpatient procedure it 's surgically placed inside the inner ear it takes about an hour and a half to two hours depending on where it 's done under general anesthesia and in the end you achieve something like this where an electrode array is inserted inside the cochlea now actually this is quite crude in comparison to our regular inner ear but here is that same girl who is implanted now this is her 10 years later and this is a video that was taken by my surgical mentor dr. john niparko who implanted her if we could play this video please john niparko so you 've written two books girl i have written two books girl no the other one was a book jn well this book has seven chapters and the last chapter is entitled " the good things about being deaf " do you remember writing that chapter girl yes i do i remember writing every chapter jn yeah girl well sometimes my sister can be kind of annoying so it comes in handy to not be annoyed by her jn i see and who is that girl holly mother her sister girl my sister jn and how can you avoid being annoyed by her girl i just take off my ci and i do n't hear anything it comes in handy jn so you do n't want to hear everything that 's out there girl no cl and so she 's phenomenal and there 's no way that you ca n't look at that as an overwhelming success it is it 's a huge success story in modern medicine however despite this incredible facility that some cochlear implant users display with language you turn on the radio and all of a sudden they ca n't hear music almost at all in fact most implant users really struggle and dislike music because it sounds so bad and so when it comes to this idea of restoring beauty to somebody 's life we have a long way to go when it comes to audition now there are a lot of reasons for that i mentioned earlier the fact that music is a different capacity because it 's abstract language is very different language is very precise in fact the whole reason we use it is because it has semantic-specificity when you say a word what you care is that word was perceived correctly you do n't care that the word sounded pretty when it was spoken music is entirely different when you hear music if it does n't sound good what 's the point there 's really very little point in listening to music when it does n't sound good to you the acoustics of music are much harder than those of language and you can see on this figure that the frequency range and the decibel range the dynamic range of music is far more heterogeneous so if we had to design a perfect cochlear implant what we would try to do is target it to be able to allow music transmission because i always view music as the pinnacle of hearing if you can hear music you should be able to hear anything now the problems begin first with pitch perception i mean most of us know that pitch is a fundamental building block of music and without the ability to perceive pitch well music and melody is a very difficult thing to do [UNK] forget about a harmony and things like that now this is a midi arrangement of rachmaninoff 's prelude now if we could just play this okay now if we consider that in a cochlear implant patient pitch perception could be off as much as two octaves let 's see what happens here when we randomize this to within one semitone we would be thrilled if we had one semitone pitch perception in cochlear implant users go ahead and play this one now my goal in showing you that is to show you that music is not robust to degradation you distort it a little bit especially in terms of pitch and you 've changed it and it might be that you kind of like that that 's kind of hypnotic but it certainly was n't the way the music was intended and you 're not hearing the same thing that most people who have normal hearing are hearing not just the ability to tell pitches apart but the ability to tell sounds apart most cochlear implant users can not tell the difference between an instrument if we could play these two sound clips in succession the trumpet and the second one that 's a violin these have similar wave forms they 're both sustained instruments cochlear implant users can not tell the difference between these instruments the sound quality or the sound of the sound is how i like to describe timbre tone color [UNK] they can not tell these things whatsoever this implant is not transmitting the quality of music that usually provides things like warmth now if you look at the brain of an individual who has a cochlear implant and you have them listen to speech have them listen to rhythm and have them listen to melody what you find is that the auditory cortex is the most active during speech you would think that because these implants are optimized for speech they were designed for speech but actually if you look at melody what you find is that there 's very little cortical activity in implant users compared with normal hearing controls so for whatever reason this implant is not successfully stimulating auditory cortices during melody perception now the next question is well how does it really sound now we 've been doing some studies to really get a sense of what sound quality is like for these implant users i 'm going to play you two clips of usher one which is normal and one which has almost no high frequencies almost no low frequencies and not even that many mid frequencies go ahead and play that i had patients tell me that those sound the same they can not differentiate sound quality differences between those two clips again we are very very far away in just getting to where we want to get to now the question comes to mind is there any hope and yes there is hope now i do n't know if anybody knows who this is this is 1 does somebody know this is beethoven now why would we know what beethoven 's skull looks like because his grave was exhumed and it turns out that his temporal bones were harvested when he died to try to look at the cause of his deafness which is why he has molding clay and his skull is bulging out on the side there but beethoven composed music long after he lost his hearing what that suggests is that even in the case of hearing loss the capacity for music remains the brains remain hardwired for music i 've been very lucky to work with dr. david ryugo where i 've been working on deaf cats that are white and trying to figure out what happens when we give them cochlear implants this is a cat that 's been trained to respond to a trumpet for food text beethoven does n't excite her the " 1812 overture " is n't worth waking for but she jumps to action when called to duty 1 cl now i 'm not suggesting that the cat is hearing that trumpet the way we 're hearing it i 'm suggesting that with training you can imbue a musical sound with significance even in a cat if we were to direct efforts towards training cochlear implant users to hear music [UNK] because right now there 's virtually no effort put towards that no rehabilitative strategies very little in the way of technological advances to actually improve music [UNK] we would come a long way now i want to show you one last video and this is of a student of mine named joseph who i had the good fortune to work with for three years in my lab he 's deaf and he learned to play the piano after he received the cochlear implant and here 's a video of joseph joseph i was born in 1986 and at about four months old i was diagnosed with profoundly severe hearing loss not long after i was fitted with hearing aids but although these hearing aids were the most powerful hearing aids on the market at the time they were n't very helpful so as a result i had to rely on lip reading a lot and i could n't really hear what people were saying when i was 12 years old i was one of the first few people in singapore who underwent cochlear implantation and not long after i got my cochlear implant i started learning how to play piano and it was absolutely wonderful since then i 've never looked back cl joseph is phenomenal he 's brilliant he is now a medical student at yale university and he 's contemplating a surgical career [UNK] one of the first deaf individuals to consider a career in surgery there are almost no deaf surgeons anywhere and this is really unheard of stuff and this is all because of this technology and the fact that he can play the piano like that is a testament to his brain truth of the matter is you can play the piano without a cochlear implant because all you have to do is press the keys at the right time you do n't actually have to hear it i know he does n't hear well because i 've heard him do karaoke and it 's one of the most awful things [UNK] heartwarming but awful and so there is certainly a lot of hope but there 's a lot more that needs to be done so i just want to conclude with the following words when it comes to restoration of hearing we have certainly come a long way a remarkably long way and we have a much longer way to go when it comes to the idea of restoring perfect hearing and let me tell you right now it 's fine that we would all be very happy with speech but i tell you if we lost our hearing if anyone here suddenly lost your hearing you would want perfect hearing back you would n't want decent hearing you would want perfect hearing restoration of basic sensory function is critical and i do n't mean to understate how important it is to restore basic function but it 's really restoration of the ability to perceive beauty where we can get inspiring and i do n't think that we should give up on beauty and i want to thank you for your time here we stand like an adam and an eve waterfalls the garden of eden two fools in love so beautiful and strong birds in the trees are smiling upon them from the age of the dinosaurs cars would run on gasoline where where have they gone now there 's nothing but flowers this was a factory now there are mountains and rivers you got it you got it we caught a rattlesnake now we 've got something for dinner you got it you got it this was a parking lot now it 's all covered with flowers you got it you got it if this is paradise i wish i had a lawnmower you got it you got it this was a shopping mall now it 's turned into corn field you got it you got it do n't leave me stranded here i ca n't get used to this lifestyle thomas dolby david byrne .now i 'm going to give you a story it 's an indian story about an indian woman and her journey let me begin with my parents i 'm a product of this visionary mother and father many years ago when i was born in the '50s [UNK] '50s and '60s did n't belong to girls in india they belonged to boys they belonged to boys who would join business and inherit business from parents and girls would be dolled up to get married my family in my city and almost in the country was unique we were four of us not one and fortunately no boys we were four girls and no boys and my parents were part of a landed property family my father defied his own grandfather almost to the point of disinheritance because he decided to educate all four of us he sent us to one of the best schools in the city and gave us the best education as i 've said when we 're born we do n't choose our parents and when we go to school we do n't choose our school children do n't choose a school they just get the school which parents choose for them so this is the foundation time which i got i grew up like this and so did my other three sisters and my father used to say at that time " i 'm going to spread all my four daughters in four corners of the world " i do n't know if he really meant [ that ] but it happened i 'm the only one who 's left in india one is a british another is an american and the third is a canadian so we are four of us in four corners of the world and since i said they 're my role models i followed two things which my father and mother gave me one they said " life is on an incline you either go up or you come down " and the second thing which has stayed with me which became my philosophy of life which made all the difference is 100 things happen in your life good or bad out of 100 90 are your creation they 're good they 're your creation enjoy it if they 're bad they 're your creation learn from it ten are nature-sent over which you ca n't do a thing it 's like a death of a relative or a cyclone or a hurricane or an earthquake you ca n't do a thing about it you 've got to just respond to the situation but that response comes out of those 90 points since i 'm a product of this philosophy of 9010 and secondly " life on an incline " that 's the way i grew up to be valuing what i got i 'm a product of opportunities rare opportunities in the '50s and the '60s which girls did n't get and i was conscious of the fact that what my parents were giving me was something unique because all of my best school friends were getting dolled up to get married with a lot of dowry and here i was with a tennis racket and going to school and doing all kinds of extracurricular activities i thought i must tell you this why i said this is the background this is what comes next i joined the indian police service as a tough woman a woman with indefatigable stamina because i used to run for my tennis titles etc but i joined the indian police service and then it was a new pattern of policing for me the policing stood for power to correct power to prevent and power to detect this is something like a new definition ever given in policing in india [UNK] the power to prevent because normally it was always said power to detect and that 's it or power to punish but i decided no it 's a power to prevent because that 's what i learned when i was growing up how do i prevent the 10 and never make it more than 10 so this was how it came into my service and it was different from the men i did n't want to make it different from the men but it was different because this was the way i was different and i redefined policing concepts in india i 'm going to take you on two journeys my policing journey and my prison journey what you see if you see the title called " pm 's car held " this was the first time a prime minister of india was given a parking ticket that 's the first time in india and i can tell you that 's the last time you 're hearing about it it 'll never happen again in india because now it was once and forever and the rule was because i was sensitive i was compassionate i was very sensitive to injustice and i was very pro-justice that 's the reason as a woman i joined the indian police service i had other options but i did n't choose them so i 'm going to move on this is about tough policing equal policing now i was known as " here 's a woman that 's not going to listen " so i was sent to all indiscriminate postings postings which others would say no i now went to a prison assignment as a police officer normally police officers do n't want to do prison they sent me to prison to lock me up thinking " now there will be no cars and no vips to be given tickets to let 's lock her up " here i got a prison assignment this was a prison assignment which was one big den of criminals obviously it was but 10,000 men of which only 400 were women [UNK] 10,000 [UNK] 9,000 plus about 600 were men terrorists rapists burglars gangsters [UNK] some of them i 'd sent to jail as a police officer outside and then how did i deal with them the first day when i went in i did n't know how to look at them and i said " do you pray " when i looked at the group i said " do you pray " they saw me as a young short woman wearing a tan suit i said " do you pray " and they did n't say anything i said " do you pray do you want to pray " they said " yes " i said " all right let 's pray " i prayed for them and things started to change this is a visual of education inside the prison friends this has never happened where everybody in the prison studies i started this with community support government had no budget it was one of the finest largest volunteerism in any prison in the world this was initiated in delhi prison you see one sample of a prisoner teaching a class these are hundreds of classes nine to eleven every prisoner went into the education program [UNK] the same den in which they thought they would put me behind the bar and things would be forgotten we converted this into an ashram [UNK] from a prison to an ashram through education i think that 's the bigger change it was the beginning of a change teachers were prisoners teachers were volunteers books came from donated schoolbooks stationery was donated everything was donated because there was no budget of education for the prison now if i 'd not done that it would have been a hellhole that 's the second landmark i want to show you some moments of history in my journey which probably you would never ever get to see anywhere in the world one the numbers you 'll never get to see secondly this concept this was a meditation program inside the prison of over 1,000 prisoners one thousand prisoners who sat in meditation this was one of the most courageous steps i took as a prison governor and this is what transformed you want to know more about this go and see this film " doing time doing vipassana " you will hear about it and you will love it and write to me on kiranbedi.com and i 'll respond to you let me show you the next slide i took the same concept of mindfulness because why did i bring meditation into the indian prison because crime is a product of a distorted mind it was distortion of mind which needed to be addressed to control not by preaching not by telling not by reading but by addressing your mind i took the same thing to the police because police equally were prisoners of their minds and they felt as if it was " we " and " they " and that the people do n't cooperate this worked this is a feedback box called a petition box this is a concept which i introduced to listen to complaints listen to grievances this was a magic box this was a sensitive box this is how a prisoner drew how they felt about the prison if you see somebody in the blue [UNK] yeah this guy [UNK] he was a prisoner and he was a teacher and you see everybody 's busy there was no time to waste let me wrap it up i 'm currently into movements movements of education of the under-served children which is thousands [UNK] india is all about thousands secondly is about the anti-corruption movement in india that 's a big way we as a small group of activists have drafted an ombudsman bill for the government of india friends you will hear a lot about it that 's the movement at the moment i 'm driving and that 's the movement and ambition of my life thank you very much thank you thank you very much thank you thank you thank you thank you .i have a question for you are you religious please raise your hand right now if you think of yourself as a religious person let 's see i 'd say about three or four percent i had no idea there were so many believers at a ted conference okay here 's another question do you think of yourself as spiritual in any way shape or form raise your hand okay that 's the majority my talk today is about the main reason or one of the main reasons why most people consider themselves to be spiritual in some way shape or form my talk today is about self-transcendence it 's just a basic fact about being human that sometimes the self seems to just melt away and when that happens the feeling is ecstatic and we reach for metaphors of up and down to explain these feelings we talk about being uplifted or elevated now it 's really hard to think about anything abstract like this without a good concrete metaphor so here 's the metaphor i 'm offering today think about the mind as being like a house with many rooms most of which we 're very familiar with but sometimes it 's as though a doorway appears from out of nowhere and it opens onto a staircase we climb the staircase and experience a state of altered consciousness in 1902 the great american psychologist william james wrote about the many varieties of religious experience he collected all kinds of case studies he quoted the words of all kinds of people who 'd had a variety of these experiences one of the most exciting to me is this young man stephen bradley had an encounter he thought with jesus in 1820 and here 's what bradley said about it stephen bradley i thought i saw the savior in human shape for about one second in the room with arms extended appearing to say to me " come " the next day i rejoiced with trembling my happiness was so great that i said i wanted to die this world had no place in my affections previous to this time i was very selfish and self-righteous but now i desired the welfare of all mankind and could with a feeling heart forgive my worst enemies jh so note how bradley 's petty moralistic self just dies on the way up the staircase and on this higher level he becomes loving and forgiving the world 's many religions have found so many ways to help people climb the staircase some shut down the self using meditation others use psychedelic drugs this is from a 16th century aztec scroll showing a man about to eat a psilocybin mushroom and at the same moment get yanked up the staircase by a god others use dancing spinning and circling to promote self-transcendence but you do n't need a religion to get you through the staircase lots of people find self-transcendence in nature others overcome their self at raves but here 's the weirdest place of all war so many books about war say the same thing that nothing brings people together like war and that bringing them together opens up the possibility of extraordinary self-transcendent experiences i 'm going to play for you an excerpt from this book by glenn gray gray was a soldier in the american army in world war ii and after the war he interviewed a lot of other soldiers and wrote about the experience of men in battle here 's a key passage where he basically describes the staircase glenn gray many veterans will admit that the experience of communal effort in battle has been the high point of their lives " i " passes insensibly into a " we " " my " becomes " our " and individual faith loses its central importance i believe that it is nothing less than the assurance of immortality that makes self-sacrifice at these moments so relatively easy i may fall but i do not die for that which is real in me goes forward and lives on in the comrades for whom i gave up my life jh so what all of these cases have in common is that the self seems to thin out or melt away and it feels good it feels really good in a way totally unlike anything we feel in our normal lives it feels somehow uplifting this idea that we move up was central in the writing of the great french sociologist emile durkheim durkheim even called us homo duplex or two-level man the lower level he called the level of the profane now profane is the opposite of sacred it just means ordinary or common and in our ordinary lives we exist as individuals we want to satisfy our individual desires we pursue our individual goals but sometimes something happens that triggers a phase change individuals unite into a team a movement or a nation which is far more than the sum of its parts durkheim called this level the level of the sacred because he believed that the function of religion was to unite people into a group into a moral community durkheim believed that anything that unites us takes on an air of sacredness and once people circle around some sacred object or value they 'll then work as a team and fight to defend it durkheim wrote about a set of intense collective emotions that accomplish this miracle of e pluribus unum of making a group out of individuals think of the collective joy in britain on the day world war ii ended think of the collective anger in tahrir square which brought down a dictator and think of the collective grief in the united states that we all felt that brought us all together after 911 so let me summarize where we are i 'm saying that the capacity for self-transcendence is just a basic part of being human i 'm offering the metaphor of a staircase in the mind i 'm saying we are homo duplex and this staircase takes us up from the profane level to the level of the sacred when we climb that staircase self-interest fades away we become just much less self-interested and we feel as though we are better nobler and somehow uplifted so here 's the million-dollar question for social scientists like me is the staircase a feature of our evolutionary design is it a product of natural selection like our hands or is it a bug a mistake in the system [UNK] this religious stuff is just something that happens when the wires cross in the brain [UNK] jill has a stroke and she has this religious experience it 's just a mistake well many scientists who study religion take this view the new atheists for example argue that religion is a set of memes sort of parasitic memes that get inside our minds and make us do all kinds of crazy religious stuff self-destructive stuff like suicide bombing and after all how could it ever be good for us to lose ourselves how could it ever be adaptive for any organism to overcome self-interest well let me show you in " the descent of man " charles darwin wrote a great deal about the evolution of morality [UNK] where did it come from why do we have it darwin noted that many of our virtues are of very little use to ourselves but they 're of great use to our groups he wrote about the scenario in which two tribes of early humans would have come in contact and competition he said " if the one tribe included a great number of courageous sympathetic and faithful members who are always ready to aid and defend each other this tribe would succeed better and conquer the other " he went on to say that " selfish and contentious people will not cohere and without coherence nothing can be effected " in other words charles darwin believed in group selection now this idea has been very controversial for the last 40 years but it 's about to make a major comeback this year especially after e.o wilson 's book comes out in april making a very strong case that we and several other species are products of group selection but really the way to think about this is as multilevel selection so look at it this way you 've got competition going on within groups and across groups so here 's a group of guys on a college crew team within this team there 's competition there are guys competing with each other the slowest rowers the weakest rowers are going to get cut from the team and only a few of these guys are going to go on in the sport maybe one of them will make it to the olympics so within the team their interests are actually pitted against each other and sometimes it would be advantageous for one of these guys to try to sabotage the other guys maybe he 'll badmouth his chief rival to the coach but while that competition is going on within the boat this competition is going on across boats and once you put these guys in a boat competing with another boat now they 've got no choice but to cooperate because they 're all in the same boat they can only win if they all pull together as a team i mean these things sound trite but they are deep evolutionary truths the main argument against group selection has always been that well sure it would be nice to have a group of cooperators but as soon as you have a group of cooperators they 're just going to get taken over by free-riders individuals that are going to exploit the hard work of the others let me illustrate this for you suppose we 've got a group of little organisms [UNK] they can be bacteria they can be hamsters it does n't matter what [UNK] and let 's suppose that this little group here they evolved to be cooperative well that 's great they graze they defend each other they work together they generate wealth and as you 'll see in this simulation as they interact they gain points as it were they grow and when they 've doubled in size you 'll see them split and that 's how they reproduce and the population grows but suppose then that one of them mutates there 's a mutation in the gene and one of them mutates to follow a selfish strategy it takes advantage of the others and so when a green interacts with a blue you 'll see the green gets larger and the blue gets smaller so here 's how things play out we start with just one green and as it interacts it gains wealth or points or food and in short order the cooperators are done for the free-riders have taken over if a group can not solve the free-rider problem then it can not reap the benefits of cooperation and group selection can not get started but there are solutions to the free-rider problem it 's not that hard a problem in fact nature has solved it many many times and nature 's favorite solution is to put everyone in the same boat for example why is it that the mitochondria in every cell has its own dna totally separate from the dna in the nucleus it 's because they used to be separate free-living bacteria and they came together and became a superorganism somehow or other [UNK] maybe one swallowed another we 'll never know exactly why [UNK] but once they got a membrane around them they were all in the same membrane now all the wealth-created division of labor all the greatness created by cooperation stays locked inside the membrane and we 've got a superorganism and now let 's rerun the simulation putting one of these superorganisms into a population of free-riders of defectors of cheaters and look what happens a superorganism can basically take what it wants it 's so big and powerful and efficient that it can take resources from the greens from the defectors the cheaters and pretty soon the whole population is actually composed of these new superorganisms what i 've shown you here is sometimes called a major transition in evolutionary history darwin 's laws do n't change but now there 's a new kind of player on the field and things begin to look very different now this transition was not a one-time freak of nature that just happened with some bacteria it happened again about 120 or a 140 million years ago when some solitary wasps began creating little simple primitive nests or hives once several wasps were all together in the same hive they had no choice but to cooperate because pretty soon they were locked into competition with other hives and the most cohesive hives won just as darwin said these early wasps gave rise to the bees and the ants that have covered the world and changed the biosphere and it happened again even more spectacularly in the last half-million years when our own ancestors became cultural creatures they came together around a hearth or a campfire they divided labor they began painting their bodies they spoke their own dialects and eventually they worshiped their own gods once they were all in the same tribe they could keep the benefits of cooperation locked inside and they unlocked the most powerful force ever known on this planet which is human cooperation [UNK] a force for construction and destruction of course human groups are nowhere near as cohesive as beehives human groups may look like hives for brief moments but they tend to then break apart we 're not locked into cooperation the way bees and ants are in fact often as we 've seen happen in a lot of the arab spring revolts often those divisions are along religious lines nonetheless when people do come together and put themselves all into the same movement they can move mountains look at the people in these photos i 've been showing you do you think they 're there pursuing their self-interest or are they pursuing communal interest which requires them to lose themselves and become simply a part of a whole okay so that was my talk delivered in the standard ted way and now i 'm going to give the whole talk over again in three minutes in a more full-spectrum sort of way jonathan haidt we humans have many varieties of religious experience as william james explained one of the most common is climbing the secret staircase and losing ourselves the staircase takes us from the experience of life as profane or ordinary upwards to the experience of life as sacred or deeply interconnected we are homo duplex as durkheim explained and we are homo duplex because we evolved by multilevel selection as darwin explained i ca n't be certain if the staircase is an adaptation rather than a bug but if it is an adaptation then the implications are profound if it is an adaptation then we evolved to be religious i do n't mean that we evolved to join gigantic organized religions those things came along too recently i mean that we evolved to see sacredness all around us and to join with others into teams and circle around sacred objects people and ideas this is why politics is so tribal politics is partly profane it 's partly about self-interest but politics is also about sacredness it 's about joining with others to pursue moral ideas it 's about the eternal struggle between good and evil and we all believe we 're on the good team and most importantly if the staircase is real it explains the persistent undercurrent of dissatisfaction in modern life because human beings are to some extent hivish creatures like bees we 're bees we busted out of the hive during the enlightenment we broke down the old institutions and brought liberty to the oppressed we unleashed earth-changing creativity and generated vast wealth and comfort nowadays we fly around like individual bees exulting in our freedom but sometimes we wonder is this all there is what should i do with my life what 's missing what 's missing is that we are homo duplex but modern secular society was built to satisfy our lower profane selves it 's really comfortable down here on the lower level come have a seat in my home entertainment center one great challenge of modern life is to find the staircase amid all the clutter and then to do something good and noble once you climb to the top i see this desire in my students at the university of virginia they all want to find a cause or calling that they can throw themselves into they 're all searching for their staircase and that gives me hope because people are not purely selfish most people long to overcome pettiness and become part of something larger and this explains the extraordinary resonance of this simple metaphor conjured up nearly 400 years ago " no man is an island entire of itself every man is a piece of the continent a part of the main " jh thank you .mockingbirds are badass they are mockingbirds [UNK] that 's mimus polyglottos [UNK] are the emcees of the animal kingdom they listen and mimic and remix what they like they rock the mic outside my window every morning i can hear them sing the sounds of the car alarms like they were songs of spring i mean if you can talk it a mockingbird can squawk it so check it i 'm gon na to catch mockingbirds i 'm going to trap mockingbirds all across the nation and put them gently into mason jars like mockingbird molotov cocktails yeah and as i drive through a neighborhood say where people got-a-lotta i 'll take a mockingbird i caught in a neighborhood where folks ai n't got nada and just let it go you know up goes the bird out come the words " juanito juanito vente a comer mi hijo 1 " oh i 'm going to be the johnny appleseed of sound cruising random city streets rocking a drop-top cadillac with a big backseat packing like 13 brown paper walmart bags full of loaded mockingbirds and i 'll get everybody i 'll get the nitwit on the network news saying " we 'll be back in a moment with more on the crisis " i 'll get some asshole at a watering hole asking what brand the ice is i 'll get that lady at the laundromat who always seems to know what being nice is i 'll get your postman making dinner plans i 'll get the last time you lied i 'll get " baby just give me the frickin ' tv guide " i 'll get a lonely little sentence with real error in it " yeah i guess i could come inside but only for a minute " i 'll get an esl class in chinatown learning " it 's raining it 's pouring " i 'll put a mockingbird on a late-night train just to get an old man snoring i 'll get your ex-lover telling someone else " good morning " i 'll get everyone 's good mornings i do n't care how you make 'em aloha konichiwa shalom ah-salam alaikum everybody means everybody means everybody here and so maybe i 'll build a gilded cage i 'll line the bottom with old notebook pages inside it i will place a mockingbird for [UNK] short explanation hippie parents what does a violin have to do with technology where in the world is this world heading on one end gold bars [UNK] on the other an entire planet we are 12 billion light years from the edge that 's a guess space is length and breadth continued indefinitely but you can not buy a ticket to travel commercially to space in america because countries are beginning to eat like us live like us and die like us you might wan na avert your gaze because that is a newt about to regenerate its limb and shaking hands spreads more germs than kissing there 's about 10 million phage per job it 's a very strange world inside a nanotube women can talk black men ski white men build strong buildings we build strong suns the surface of the earth is absolutely riddled with holes and here we are right in the middle it is the voice of life that calls us to come and learn when all the little mockingbirds fly away they 're going to sound like the last four days i will get uptown gurus downtown teachers broke-ass artists and dealers and filipino preachers leaf blowers bartenders boob-job doctors hooligans garbage men your local congressmen in the spotlight guys in the overhead helicopters everybody gets heard everybody gets this one honest mockingbird as a witness and i 'm on this i 'm on this 'til the whole thing spreads with chat rooms and copycats and moms maybe tucking kids into bed singing " hush little baby do n't say a word wait for the man with the mockingbird " yeah and then come the news crews and the man-in-the-street interviews and the letters to the editor everybody asking just who is responsible for this citywide nationwide mockingbird cacophony and somebody finally is going to tip the city council of monterey california off to me and they 'll offer me a key to the city a gold-plated oversized key to the city and that is all i need 'cause if i get that i can unlock the air i 'll listen for what 's missing and i 'll put it there thank you ted chris anderson wow wow .cultural evolution is a dangerous child for any species to let loose on its planet by the time you realize what 's happening the child is a toddler up and causing havoc and it 's too late to put it back we humans are earth 's pandoran species we 're the ones who let the second replicator out of its box and we ca n't push it back in we 're seeing the consequences all around us now that i suggest is the view that comes out of taking memetics seriously and it gives us a new way of thinking about not only what 's going on on our planet but what might be going on elsewhere in the cosmos so first of all i 'd like to say something about memetics and the theory of memes and secondly how this might answer questions about who 's out there if indeed anyone is so memetics memetics is founded on the principle of universal darwinism darwin had this amazing idea indeed some people say it 's the best idea anybody ever had is n't that a wonderful thought that there could be such a thing as a best idea anybody ever had do you think there could audience no susan blackmore someone says no very loudly from over there well i say yes and if there is i give the prize to darwin why because the idea was so simple and yet it explains all design in the universe i would say not just biological design but all of the design that we think of as human design it 's all just the same thing happening what did darwin say i know you know the idea natural selection but let me just paraphrase " the origin of species " 1859 in a few sentences what darwin said was something like this if you have creatures that vary and that ca n't be doubted [UNK] i 've been to the galapagos and i 've measured the size of the beaks and the size of the turtle shells and so on and so on and 100 pages later and if there is a struggle for life such that nearly all of these creatures die [UNK] and this ca n't be doubted i 've read malthus and i 've calculated how long it would take for elephants to cover the whole world if they bred unrestricted and so on and so on and another 100 pages later and if the very few that survive pass onto their offspring whatever it was that helped them survive then those offspring must be better adapted to the circumstances in which all this happened than their parents were you see the idea if if if then he had no concept of the idea of an algorithm but that 's what he described in that book and this is what we now know as the evolutionary algorithm the principle is you just need those three things [UNK] variation selection and heredity and as dan dennett puts it if you have those then you must get evolution or design out of chaos without the aid of mind there 's one word i love on that slide what do you think my favorite word is audience chaos sb chaos no what mind no audience without sb no not without you try them all in order mmm 1 audience must sb must at must must must this is what makes it so amazing you do n't need a designer or a plan or foresight or anything else if there 's something that is copied with variation and it 's selected then you must get design appearing out of nowhere you ca n't stop it must is my favorite word there now what 's this to do with memes well the principle here applies to anything that is copied with variation and selection we 're so used to thinking in terms of biology we think about genes this way darwin did n't of course he did n't know about genes he talked mostly about animals and plants but also about languages evolving and becoming extinct but the principle of universal darwinism is that any information that is varied and selected will produce design and this is what richard dawkins was on about in his 1976 bestseller " the selfish gene " the information that is copied he called the replicator it selfishly copies not meaning it kind of sits around inside cells going " i want to get copied " but that it will get copied if it can regardless of the consequences it does n't care about the consequences because it ca n't because it 's just information being copied and he wanted to get away from everybody thinking all the time about genes and so he said " is there another replicator out there on the planet " ah yes there is look around you [UNK] here will do in this room all around us still clumsily drifting about in its primeval soup of culture is another replicator information that we copy from person to person by imitation by language by talking by telling stories by wearing clothes by doing things this is information copied with variation and selection this is design process going on he wanted a name for the new replicator so he took the greek word " mimeme " which means that which is imitated remember that that 's the core definition that which is imitated and abbreviated it to meme just because it sounds good and made a good meme an effective spreading meme so that 's how the idea came about it 's important to stick with that definition the whole science of memetics is much maligned much misunderstood much feared but a lot of these problems can be avoided by remembering the definition a meme is not equivalent to an idea it 's not an idea it 's not equivalent to anything else really stick with the definition it 's that which is imitated or information which is copied from person to person so let 's see some memes well you sir you 've got those glasses hung around your neck in that particularly fetching way i wonder whether you invented that idea for yourself or copied it from someone else if you copied it from someone else it 's a meme and what about oh i ca n't see any interesting memes here all right everyone who 's got some interesting memes for me oh well your earrings i do n't suppose you invented the idea of earrings you probably went out and bought them there are plenty more in the shops that 's something that 's passed on from person to person all the stories that we 're telling [UNK] well of course ted is a great meme-fest masses of memes the way to think about memes though is to think why do they spread they 're selfish information they will get copied if they can but some of them will be copied because they 're good or true or useful or beautiful some of them will be copied even though they 're not some it 's quite hard to tell why there 's one particular curious meme which i rather enjoy and i 'm glad to say as i expected i found it when i came here and i 'm sure all of you found it too you go to your nice posh international hotel somewhere and you come in and you put down your clothes and you go to the bathroom and what do you see audience bathroom soap sb pardon audience soap sb soap yeah what else do you see audience sb mmm mmm audience sink toilet 1 sb sink toilet yes these are all memes they 're all memes but they 're sort of useful ones and then there 's this one what is this one doing this has spread all over the world it 's not surprising that you all found it when you arrived in your bathrooms here but i took this photograph in a toilet at the back of a tent in the eco-camp in the jungle in assam who folded that thing up there and why some people get carried away other people are just lazy and make mistakes some hotels exploit the opportunity to put even more memes with a little sticker what is this all about i suppose it 's there to tell you that somebody 's cleaned the place and it 's all lovely and you know actually all it tells you is that another person has potentially spread germs from place to place so think of it this way imagine a world full of brains and far more memes than can possibly find homes the memes are all trying to get copied [UNK] trying in inverted commas [UNK] i.e. that 's the shorthand for if they can get copied they will they 're using you and me as their propagating copying machinery and we are the meme machines now why is this important why is this useful or what does it tell us it gives us a completely new view of human origins and what it means to be human all conventional theories of cultural evolution of the origin of humans and what makes us so different from other species all other theories explaining the big brain and language and tool use and all these things that make us unique are based upon genes language must have been useful for the genes tool use must have enhanced our survival mating and so on it always comes back as richard dawkins complained all that long time ago it always comes back to genes the point of memetics is to say " oh no it does n't " there are two replicators now on this planet from the moment that our ancestors perhaps two and a half million years ago or so began imitating there was a new copying process copying with variation and selection a new replicator was let loose and it could never be [UNK] right from the start [UNK] it could never be that human beings who let loose this new creature could just copy the useful beautiful true things and not copy the other things while their brains were having an advantage from being able to copy [UNK] lighting fires keeping fires going new techniques of hunting these kinds of things [UNK] inevitably they were also copying putting feathers in their hair or wearing strange clothes or painting their faces or whatever so you get an arms race between the genes which are trying to get the humans to have small economical brains and not waste their time copying all this stuff and the memes themselves like the sounds that people made and copied [UNK] in other words what turned out to be language [UNK] competing to get the brains to get bigger and bigger so the big brain on this theory is driven by the memes this is why in " the meme machine " i called it memetic drive as the memes evolve as they inevitably must they drive a bigger brain that is better at copying the memes that are doing the driving this is why we 've ended up with such peculiar brains that we like religion and music and art language is a parasite that we 've adapted to not something that was there originally for our genes on this view and like most parasites it can begin dangerous but then it coevolves and adapts and we end up with a symbiotic relationship with this new parasite and so from our perspective we do n't realize that that 's how it began so this is a view of what humans are all other species on this planet are gene machines only they do n't imitate at all well hardly at all we alone are gene machines and meme machines as well the memes took a gene machine and turned it into a meme machine but that 's not all we have a new kind of memes now i 've been wondering for a long time since i 've been thinking about memes a lot is there a difference between the memes that we copy [UNK] the words we speak to each other the gestures we copy the human things [UNK] and all these technological things around us i have always until now called them all memes but i do honestly think now we need a new word for technological memes let 's call them techno-memes or temes because the processes are getting different we began perhaps 5,000 years ago with writing we put the storage of memes out there on a clay tablet but in order to get true temes and true teme machines you need to get the variation the selection and the copying all done outside of humans and we 're getting there we 're at this extraordinary point where we 're nearly there that there are machines like that and indeed in the short time i 've already been at ted i see we 're even closer than i thought we were before so actually now the temes are forcing our brains to become more like teme machines our children are growing up very quickly learning to read learning to use machinery we 're going to have all kinds of implants drugs that force us to stay awake all the time we 'll think we 're choosing these things but the temes are making us do it so we 're at this cusp now of having a third replicator on our planet now what about what else is going on out there in the universe is there anyone else out there people have been asking this question for a long time we 've been asking it here at ted already in 1961 frank drake made his famous equation but i think he concentrated on the wrong things it 's been very productive that equation he wanted to estimate n the number of communicative civilizations out there in our galaxy and he included in there the rate of star formation the rate of planets but crucially intelligence i think that 's the wrong way to think about it intelligence appears all over the place in all kinds of guises human intelligence is only one kind of a thing but what 's really important is the replicators you have and the levels of replicators one feeding on the one before so i would suggest that we do n't think intelligence we think replicators and on that basis i 've suggested a different kind of equation a very simple equation n the same thing the number of communicative civilizations out there [ that ] we might expect in our galaxy just start with the number of planets there are in our galaxy the fraction of those which get a first replicator the fraction of those that get the second replicator the fraction of those that get the third replicator because it 's only the third replicator that 's going to reach out [UNK] sending information sending probes getting out there and communicating with anywhere else ok so if we take that equation why have n't we heard from anybody out there because every step is dangerous getting a new replicator is dangerous you can pull through we have pulled through but it 's dangerous take the first step as soon as life appeared on this earth we may take the gaian view i loved peter ward 's talk yesterday [UNK] it 's not gaian all the time actually life forms produce things that kill themselves well we did pull through on this planet but then a long time later billions of years later we got the second replicator the memes that was dangerous all right think of the big brain how many mothers do we have here you know all about big brains they are dangerous to give birth to are agonizing to give birth to my cat gave birth to four kittens purring all the time ah mm [UNK] slightly different but not only is it painful it kills lots of babies it kills lots of mothers and it 's very expensive to produce the genes are forced into producing all this myelin all the fat to myelinate the brain do you know sitting here your brain is using about 20 percent of your body 's energy output for two percent of your body weight it 's a really expensive organ to run why because it 's producing the memes now it could have killed us off it could have killed us off and maybe it nearly did but you see we do n't know but maybe it nearly did has it been tried before what about all those other species louise leakey talked yesterday about how we 're the only one in this branch left what happened to the others could it be that this experiment in imitation this experiment in a second replicator is dangerous enough to kill people off well we did pull through and we adapted but now we 're hitting as i 've just described we 're hitting the third replicator point and this is even more dangerous [UNK] well it 's dangerous again why because the temes are selfish replicators and they do n't care about us or our planet or anything else they 're just information why would they they are using us to suck up the planet 's resources to produce more computers and more of all these amazing things we 're hearing about here at ted do n't think " oh we created the internet for our own benefit " that 's how it seems to us think temes spreading because they must we are the old machines now are we going to pull through what 's going to happen what does it mean to pull through well there are kind of two ways of pulling through one that is obviously happening all around us now is that the temes turn us into teme machines with these implants with the drugs with us merging with the technology and why would they do that because we are self-replicating we have babies we make new ones and so it 's convenient to piggyback on us because we 're not yet at the stage on this planet where the other option is viable although it 's closer i heard this morning it 's closer than i thought it was where the teme machines themselves will replicate themselves that way it would n't matter if the planet 's climate was utterly destabilized and it was no longer possible for humans to live here because those teme machines they would n't need [UNK] they 're not squishy wet oxygen-breathing warmth-requiring creatures they could carry on without us so those are the two possibilities the second i do n't think we 're that close it 's coming but we 're not there yet the first it 's coming too but the damage that is already being done to the planet is showing us how dangerous the third point is that third danger point getting a third replicator and will we get through this third danger point like we got through the second and like we got through the first maybe we will maybe we wo n't i have no idea chris anderson that was an incredible talk sb thank you i scared myself ca transcript urlhttpwww.ted.comtalkspeter_haas_haiti_s_disaster_of_engineering.htmlurl description"Haiti was not a natural disaster," says TED Fellow Peter Haas "It was a disaster of engineering."

relief,global issues,technologykeywords talkid978talkid titlePeter Haas Haiti's disaster of engineeringtitle transcript i learned about the haiti earthquake by skype my wife sent me a message " whoa earthquake " and then disappeared for 25 minutes it was 25 minutes of absolute terror that thousands of people across the u.s. felt i was afraid of a tsunami what i did n't realize was there was a greater terror in haiti and that was building collapse we 've all seen the photos of the collapsed buildings in haiti these are shots my wife took a couple days after the quake while i was making my way through the d.r into the country this is the national palace [UNK] the equivalent of the white house this is the largest supermarket in the caribbean at peak shopping time this is a nurses ' college [UNK] there are 300 nurses studying the general hospital right next door emerged largely unscathed this is the ministry of economics and finance we have all heard about the tremendous human loss in the earthquake in haiti but we have n't heard enough about why all those lives were lost we have n't heard about why the buildings failed after all it was the buildings not the earthquake that killed 220,000 people that injured 330,000 that displaced 1.3 million people that cut off food and water and supplies for an entire nation this is the largest metropolitan-area disaster in decades and it was not a natural disaster [UNK] it was a disaster of engineering aidg has worked in haiti since 2007 providing engineering and business support to small businesses and after the quake we started bringing in earthquake engineers to figure out why the buildings collapsed to examine what was safe and what was n't working with minustah which is the u.n. mission in haiti with the ministry of public works with different ngos we inspected over 1,500 buildings we inspected schools and private residencies we inspected medical centers and food warehouses we inspected government buildings this is the ministry of justice behind that door is the national judicial archives the fellow in the door andre filitrault [UNK] who 's the director of the center for interdisciplinary earthquake engineering research at the university of buffalo [UNK] was examining it to see if it was safe to recover the archives andre told me after seeing these buildings fail again and again in the same way that there is no new research here there is nothing here that we do n't know the failure points were the same walls and slabs not tied properly into columns [UNK] that 's a roof slab hanging off the building [UNK] cantilevered structures or structures that were asymmetric that shook violently and came down poor building materials not enough concrete not enough compression in the blocks rebar that was smooth rebar that was exposed to the weather and had rusted away now there 's a solution to all these problems and we know how to build properly the proof of this came in chile almost a month later when 8.8 magnitude earthquake hit chile that is 500 times the power of the 7.0 that hit port-au-prince [UNK] 500 times the power yet only under a thousand casualties adjusted for population density that is less than one percent of the impact of the haitian quake what was the difference between chile and haiti seismic standards and confined masonry where the building acts as a whole [UNK] walls and columns and roofs and slabs tied together to support each other [UNK] instead of breaking off into separate members and failing if you look at this building in chile it 's ripped in half but it 's not a pile of rubble chileans have been building with confined masonry for decades right now aidg is working with kpff consulting engineers architecture for humanity to bring more confined masonry training into haiti this is xantus daniel he 's a mason just a general construction worker not a foreman who took one of our trainings on his last job he was working with his boss and they started pouring the columns wrong he took his boss aside and he showed him the materials on confined masonry he showed him " you know we do n't have to do this wrong it wo n't cost us any more to do it the right way " and they redid that building they tied the rebar right they poured the columns right and that building will be safe and every building that they build going forward will be safe to make sure these buildings are safe it 's not going to take policy [UNK] it 's going to take reaching out to the masons on the ground and helping them learn the proper techniques now there are many groups doing this and the fellow in the vest there craig toten he has pushed forward to get documentation out to all the groups that are doing this through haiti rewired through build change architecture for humanity aidg there is the possibility to reach out to 30,000 [UNK] 40,000 masons across the country and create a movement of proper building if you reach out to the people on the ground in this collaborative way it 's extremely affordable for the billions spent on reconstruction you can train masons for dollars on every house that they end up building over their lifetime ultimately there are two ways that you can rebuild haiti the way at the top is the way that haiti 's been building for decades the way at the top is a poorly constructed building that will fail the way at the bottom is a confined masonry building where the walls are tied together the building is symmetric and it will stand up to an earthquake for all the disaster there is an opportunity here to build better houses for the next generation so that when the next earthquake hits it is a disaster [UNK] but not a tragedy .thank you so much it 's really scary to be here among the smartest of the smart i 'm here to tell you a few tales of passion there 's a jewish saying that i love what is truer than truth answer the story i 'm a storyteller i want to convey something that is truer than truth about our common humanity all stories interest me and some haunt me until i end up writing them certain themes keep coming up justice loyalty violence death political and social issues freedom i 'm aware of the mystery around us so i write about coincidences premonitions emotions dreams the power of nature magic in the last 20 years i have published a few books but i have lived in anonymity until february of 2006 when i carried the olympic flag in the winter olympics in italy that made me a celebrity now people recognize me in macy 's and my grandchildren think that i 'm cool allow me to tell you about my four minutes of fame one of the organizers of the olympic ceremony of the opening ceremony called me and said that i had been selected to be one of the flag-bearers i replied that surely this was a case of mistaken identity because i 'm as far as you can get from being an athlete actually i was n't even sure that i could go around the stadium without a walker i was told that this was no laughing matter this would be the first time that only women would carry the olympic flag five women representing five continents and three olympic gold medal winners my first question was naturally what was i going to wear a uniform she said and asked for my measurements my measurements i had a vision of myself in a fluffy anorak looking like the michelin man by the middle of february i found myself in turin where enthusiastic crowds cheered when any of the 80 olympic teams was in the street those athletes had sacrificed everything to compete in the games they all deserved to win but there 's the element of luck a speck of snow an inch of ice the force of the wind can determine the result of a race or a game however what matters most [UNK] more than training or luck [UNK] is the heart only a fearless and determined heart will get the gold medal it is all about passion the streets of turin were covered with red posters announcing the slogan of the olympics passion lives here is n't it always true heart is what drives us and determines our fate that is what i need for my characters in my books a passionate heart i need mavericks dissidents adventurers outsiders and rebels who ask questions bend the rules and take risks people like all of you in this room nice people with common sense do not make interesting characters they only make good former spouses in the green room of the stadium i met the other flag bearers three athletes and the actresses susan sarandon and sophia loren also two women with passionate hearts wangari maathai the nobel prizewinner from kenya who has planted 30 million trees and by doing so she has changed the soil the weather in some places in africa and of course the economic conditions in many villages and somaly mam a cambodian activist who fights passionately against child prostitution when she was 14 years old her grandfather sold her to a brothel she told us of little girls raped by men who believe that having sex with a very young virgin will cure them from aids and of brothels where children are forced to receive five 15 clients per day and if they rebel they are tortured with electricity in the green room i received my uniform it was not the kind of outfit that i normally wear but it was far from the michelin man suit that i had anticipated not bad really i looked like a refrigerator but so did most of the flag-bearers except sophia loren the universal symbol of beauty and passion sophia is over 70 and she looks great she 's sexy slim and tall with a deep tan now how can you have a deep tan and have no wrinkles i do n't know when asked in a tv interview " how could she look so good " she replied " posture my back is always straight and i do n't make old people 's noises " so there you have some free advice from one of the most beautiful women on earth no grunting no coughing no wheezing no talking to yourselves no farting well she did n't say that exactly at some point around midnight we were summoned to the wings of the stadium and the loudspeakers announced the olympic flag and the music started [UNK] by the way the same music that starts here the aida march sophia loren was right in front of me [UNK] she 's a foot taller than i am not counting the poofy hair she walked elegantly like a giraffe on the african savannah holding the flag on her shoulder i jogged behind [UNK] on my tiptoes [UNK] holding the flag on my extended arm so that my head was actually under the damn flag all the cameras were of course on sophia that was fortunate for me because in most press photos i appear too although often between sophia 's legs a place where most men would love to be the best four minutes of my entire life were those in the olympic stadium my husband is offended when i say this [UNK] although i have explained to him that what we do in private usually takes less than four minutes [UNK] [UNK] so he should n't take it personally i have all the press clippings of those four magnificent minutes because i do n't want to forget them when old age destroys my brain cells i want to carry in my heart forever the key word of the olympics [UNK] passion so here 's a tale of passion the year is 1998 the place is a prison camp for tutsi refugees in congo by the way 80 percent of all refugees and displaced people in the world are women and girls we can call this place in congo a death camp because those who are not killed will die of disease or starvation the protagonists of this story are a young woman rose mapendo and her children she 's pregnant and a widow soldiers have forced her to watch as her husband was tortured and killed somehow she manages to keep her seven children alive and a few months later she gives birth to premature twins two tiny little boys she cuts the umbilical cord with a stick and ties it with her own hair she names the twins after the camp 's commanders to gain their favor and feeds them with black tea because her milk can not sustain them when the soldiers burst in her cell to rape her oldest daughter she grabs hold of her and refuses to let go even when they hold a gun to her head somehow the family survives for 16 months and then by extraordinary luck and the passionate heart of a young american man sasha chanoff who manages to put her in a u.s. rescue plane rose mapendo and her nine children end up in phoenix arizona where they 're now living and thriving mapendo in swahili means great love the protagonists of my books are strong and passionate women like rose mapendo i do n't make them up there 's no need for that i look around and i see them everywhere i have worked with women and for women all my life i know them well i was born in ancient times at the end of the world in a patriarchal catholic and conservative family no wonder that by age five i was a raging feminist [UNK] although the term had not reached chile yet so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me i would soon find out that there was a high price to pay for my freedom and for questioning the patriarchy but i was happy to pay it because for every blow that i received i was able to deliver two once when my daughter paula was in her twenties she said to me that feminism was dated that i should move on we had a memorable fight feminism is dated yes for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world who are still forced into premature marriage prostitution forced labor [UNK] they have children that they do n't want or they can not feed they have no control over their bodies or their lives they have no education and no freedom they are raped beaten up and sometimes killed with impunity for most western young women of today being called a feminist is an insult feminism has never been sexy but let me assure you that it never stopped me from flirting and i have seldom suffered from lack of men feminism is not dead by no means it has evolved if you do n't like the term change it for goddess ' sake call it aphrodite or venus or bimbo or whatever you want the name does n't matter as long as we understand what it is about and we support it so here 's another tale of passion and this is a sad one the place is a small women 's clinic in a village in bangladesh the year is 2005 jenny is a young american dental hygienist who has gone to the clinic as a volunteer during her three-week vacation she 's prepared to clean teeth but when she gets there she finds out that there are no doctors no dentists and the clinic is just a hut full of flies outside there is a line of women who have waited several hours to be treated the first patient is in excruciating pain because she has several rotten molars jenny realizes that the only solution is to pull out the bad teeth she 's not licensed for that she has never done it she risks a lot and she 's terrified she does n't even have the proper instruments but fortunately she has brought some novocaine jenny has a brave and passionate heart she murmurs a prayer and she goes ahead with the operation at the end the relieved patient kisses her hands that day the hygienist pulls out many more teeth the next morning when she comes again to the so-called clinic her first patient is waiting for her with her husband the woman 's face looks like a watermelon it is so swollen that you ca n't even see the eyes the husband furious threatens to kill the american jenny is horrified at what she has done but then the translator explains that the patient 's condition has nothing to do with the operation the day before her husband beat her up because she was not home in time to prepare dinner for him millions of women live like this today they are the poorest of the poor although women do two-thirds of the world 's labor they own less than one percent of the world 's assets they are paid less than men for the same work if they 're paid at all and they remain vulnerable because they have no economic independence and they are constantly threatened by exploitation violence and abuse it is a fact that giving women education work the ability to control their own income inherit and own property benefits the society if a woman is empowered her children and her family will be better off if families prosper the village prospers and eventually so does the whole country wangari maathai goes to a village in kenya she talks with the women and explains that the land is barren because they have cut and sold the trees she gets the women to plant new trees and water them drop by drop in a matter of five or six years they have a forest the soil is enriched and the village is saved the poorest and most backward societies are always those that put women down yet this obvious truth is ignored by governments and also by philanthropy for every dollar given to a women 's program 20 dollars are given to men 's programs women are 51 percent of humankind empowering them will change everything [UNK] more than technology and design and entertainment i can promise you that women working together [UNK] linked informed and educated [UNK] can bring peace and prosperity to this forsaken planet in any war today most of the casualties are civilians mainly women and children they are collateral damage men run the world and look at the mess we have what kind of world do we want this is a fundamental question that most of us are asking does it make sense to participate in the existing world order we want a world where life is preserved and the quality of life is enriched for everybody not only for the privileged in january i saw an exhibit of fernando botero 's paintings at the uc berkeley library no museum or gallery in the united states except for the new york gallery that carries botero 's work has dared to show the paintings because the theme is the abu ghraib prison they are huge paintings of torture and abuse of power in the voluminous botero style i have not been able to get those images out of my mind or my heart what i fear most is power with impunity i fear abuse of power and the power to abuse in our species the alpha males define reality and force the rest of the pack to accept that reality and follow the rules the rules change all the time but they always benefit them and in this case the trickle-down effect which does not work in economics works perfectly abuse trickles down from the top of the ladder to the bottom women and children especially the poor are at the bottom even the most destitute of men have someone they can abuse [UNK] a woman or a child i 'm fed up with the power that a few exert over the many through gender income race and class i think that the time is ripe to make fundamental changes in our civilization but for real change we need feminine energy in the management of the world we need a critical number of women in positions of power and we need to nurture the feminine energy in men i 'm talking about men with young minds of course old guys are hopeless we have to wait for them to die off yes i would love to have sophia loren 's long legs and legendary breasts but given a choice i would rather have the warrior hearts of wangari maathai somaly mam jenny and rose mapendo i want to make this world good not better but to make it good why not it is possible look around in this room [UNK] all this knowledge energy talent and technology let 's get off our fannies roll up our sleeves and get to work passionately in creating an almost perfect world thank you .well i thought there would be a podium so i 'm a bit scared chris asked me to tell again how we found the structure of dna and since you know i follow his orders i 'll do it but it slightly bores me and you know i wrote a book so i 'll say something [UNK] [UNK] i 'll say a little about you know how the discovery was made and why francis and i found it and then i hope maybe i have at least five minutes to say what makes me tick now in back of me is a picture of me when i was 17 i was at the university of chicago in my third year and i was in my third year because the university of chicago let you in after two years of high school so you [UNK] it was fun to get away from high school [UNK] [UNK] because i was very small and i was no good in sports or anything like that but i should say that my background [UNK] my father was you know raised to be an episcopalian and republican but after one year of college he became an atheist and a democrat and my mother was irish catholic and [UNK] but she did n't take religion too seriously and by the age of 11 i was no longer going to sunday mass and going on birdwatching walks with my father so early on i heard of charles darwin i guess you know he was the big hero and you know you understand life as it now exists through evolution and at the university of chicago i was a zoology major and thought i would end up you know if i was bright enough maybe getting a ph.d. from cornell in ornithology then in the chicago paper there was a review of a book called " what is life " by the great physicist schrodinger and that of course had been a question i wanted to know you know darwin explained life after it got started but what was the essence of life and schrodinger said the essence was information present in our chromosomes and it had to be present on a molecule i 'd never really thought of molecules before you know chromosomes but this was a molecule and somehow all the information was probably present in some digital form and there was the big question of how did you copy the information so that was the book and so from that moment on i wanted to be a geneticist [UNK] understand the gene and through that understand life so i had you know a hero at a distance it was n't a baseball player it was linus pauling and so i applied to caltech and they turned me down so i went to indiana which was actually as good as caltech in genetics and besides they had a really good basketball team so i had a really quite happy life at indiana and it was at indiana i got the impression that you know the gene was likely to be dna and so when i got my ph.d. i should go and search for dna so i first went to copenhagen because i thought well maybe i could become a biochemist but i discovered biochemistry was very boring it was n't going anywhere toward you know saying what the gene was it was just nuclear science and oh that 's the book little book you can read it in about two hours and [UNK] but then i went to a meeting in italy and there was an unexpected speaker who was n't on the program and he talked about dna and this was maurice wilkins he was trained as a physicist and after the war he wanted to do biophysics and he picked dna because dna had been determined at the rockefeller institute to possibly be the genetic molecules on the chromosomes most people believed it was proteins but wilkins you know thought dna was the best bet and he showed this x-ray photograph sort of crystalline so dna had a structure even though it owed it to probably different molecules carrying different sets of instructions so there was something universal about the dna molecule so i wanted to work with him but he did n't want a former birdwatcher and i ended up in cambridge england so i went to cambridge because it was really the best place in the world then for x-ray crystallography and x-ray crystallography is now a subject in you know chemistry departments i mean in those days it was the domain of the physicists so the best place for x-ray crystallography was at the cavendish laboratory at cambridge and there i met francis crick i went there without knowing him he was 35 i was 23 and within a day we had decided that maybe we could take a shortcut to finding the structure of dna not solve it like you know in rigorous fashion but build a model an electro-model using some coordinates of you know length all that sort of stuff from x-ray photographs but just ask what the molecule [UNK] how should it fold up and the reason for doing so at the center of this photograph is linus pauling about six months before he proposed the alpha helical structure for proteins and in doing so he banished the man out on the right sir lawrence bragg who was the cavendish professor this is a photograph several years later when bragg had cause to smile he certainly was n't smiling when i got there because he was somewhat humiliated by pauling getting the alpha helix and the cambridge people failing because they were n't chemists and certainly neither crick or i were chemists so we tried to build a model and he knew francis knew wilkins so wilkins said he thought it was the helix x-ray diagram he thought was comparable with the helix so we built a three-stranded model the people from london came up wilkins and this collaborator or possible collaborator rosalind franklin came up and sort of laughed at our model they said it was lousy and it was so we were told to build no more models we were incompetent and so we did n't build any models and francis sort of continued to work on proteins and basically i did nothing and [UNK] except read you know basically reading is a good thing you get facts and we kept telling the people in london that linus pauling 's going to move on to dna if dna is that important linus will know it he 'll build a model and then we 're going to be scooped and in fact he 'd written the people in london could he see their x-ray photograph and they had the wisdom to say " no " so he did n't have it but there was ones in the literature actually linus did n't look at them that carefully but about oh 15 months after i got to cambridge a rumor began to appear from linus pauling 's son who was in cambridge that his father was now working on dna and so one day peter came in and he said he was peter pauling and he gave me a copy of his father 's manuscripts and boy i was scared because i thought you know we may be scooped i have nothing to do no qualifications for anything and so there was the paper and he proposed a three-stranded structure and i read it and it was just [UNK] it was crap so this was you know unexpected from the world 's [UNK] [UNK] and so it was held together by hydrogen bonds between phosphate groups well if the peak ph that cells have is around seven those hydrogen bonds could n't exist we rushed over to the chemistry department and said " could pauling be right " and alex hust said " no " so we were happy and you know we were still in the game but we were frightened that somebody at caltech would tell linus that he was wrong and so bragg said " build models " and a month after we got the pauling manuscript [UNK] i should say i took the manuscript to london and showed the people well i said linus was wrong and that we 're still in the game and that they should immediately start building models but wilkins said " no " rosalind franklin was leaving in about two months and after she left he would start building models and so i came back with that news to cambridge and bragg said " build models " well of course i wanted to build models and there 's a picture of rosalind she really you know in one sense she was a chemist but really she would have been trained [UNK] she did n't know any organic chemistry or quantum chemistry she was a crystallographer and i think part of the reason she did n't want to build models was she was n't a chemist whereas pauling was a chemist and so crick and i you know started building models and i 'd learned a little chemistry but not enough well we got the answer on the 28th february '53 and it was because of a rule which to me is a very good rule never be the brightest person in a room and we were n't we were n't the best chemists in the room i went in and showed them a pairing i 'd done and jerry donohue [UNK] he was a chemist [UNK] he said it 's wrong you 've got [UNK] the hydrogen atoms are in the wrong place i just put them down like they were in the books he said they were wrong so the next day you know after i thought " well he might be right " so i changed the locations and then we found the base pairing and francis immediately said the chains run in absolute directions and we knew we were right so it was a pretty you know it all happened in about two hours from nothing to thing and we knew it was big because you know if you just put a next to t and g next to c you have a copying mechanism so we saw how genetic information is carried it 's the order of the four bases so in a sense it is a sort of digital-type information and you copy it by going from strand-separating so you know if it did n't work this way you might as well believe it because you did n't have any other scheme but that 's not the way most scientists think most scientists are really rather dull they said we wo n't think about it until we know it 's right but you know we thought well it 's at least 95 percent right or 99 percent right so think about it the next five years there were essentially something like five references to our work in " nature " [UNK] none and so we were left by ourselves and trying to do the last part of the trio how do you [UNK] what does this genetic information do it was pretty obvious that it provided the information to an rna molecule and then how do you go from rna to protein for about three years we just [UNK] i tried to solve the structure of rna it did n't yield it did n't give good x-ray photographs i was decidedly unhappy a girl did n't marry me it was really you know sort of a shitty time so there 's a picture of francis and i before i met the girl so i 'm still looking happy but there is what we did when we did n't know where to go forward we formed a club and called it the rna tie club george gamow also a great physicist he designed the tie he was one of the members the question was how do you go from a four-letter code to the 20-letter code of proteins feynman was a member and teller and friends of gamow but that 's the only [UNK] no we were only photographed twice and on both occasions you know one of us was missing the tie there 's francis up on the upper right and alex rich [UNK] the m.d.-turned-crystallographer [UNK] is next to me this was taken in cambridge in september of 1955 and i 'm smiling sort of forced i think because the girl i had boy she was gone and so i did n't really get happy until 1960 because then we found out basically you know that there are three forms of rna and we knew basically dna provides the information for rna rna provides the information for protein and that let marshall nirenberg you know take rna [UNK] synthetic rna [UNK] put it in a system making protein he made polyphenylalanine polyphenylalanine so that 's the first cracking of the genetic code and it was all over by 1966 so there that 's what chris wanted me to do it was [UNK] so what happened since then well at that time [UNK] i should go back when we found the structure of dna i gave my first talk at cold spring harbor the physicist leo szilard he looked at me and said " are you going to patent this " and [UNK] but he knew patent law and that we could n't patent it because you could n't no use for it and so dna did n't become a useful molecule and the lawyers did n't enter into the equation until 1973 20 years later when boyer and cohen in san francisco and stanford came up with their method of recombinant dna and stanford patented it and made a lot of money at least they patented something which you know could do useful things and then they learned how to read the letters for the code and boom we 've you know had a biotech industry and but we were still a long ways from you know answering a question which sort of dominated my childhood which is how do you nature-nurture and so i 'll go on i 'm already out of time but this is michael wigler a very very clever mathematician turned physicist and he developed a technique which essentially will let us look at sample dna and eventually a million spots along it there 's a chip there a conventional one then there 's one made by a photolithography by a company in madison called nimblegen which is way ahead of affymetrix and we use their technique and what you can do is sort of compare dna of normal segs versus cancer and you can see on the top that cancers which are bad show insertions or deletions so the dna is really badly mucked up whereas if you have a chance of surviving the dna is n't so mucked up so we think that this will eventually lead to what we call " dna biopsies " before you get treated for cancer you should really look at this technique and get a feeling of the face of the enemy it 's not a [UNK] it 's only a partial look but it 's a [UNK] i think it 's going to be very very useful so we started with breast cancer because there 's lots of money for it no government money and now i have a sort of vested interest i want to do it for prostate cancer so you know you are n't treated if it 's not dangerous but wigler besides looking at cancer cells looked at normal cells and made a really sort of surprising observation which is all of us have about 10 places in our genome where we 've lost a gene or gained another one so we 're sort of all imperfect and the question is well if we 're around here you know these little losses or gains might not be too bad but if these deletions or amplifications occurred in the wrong gene maybe we 'll feel sick so the first disease he looked at is autism and the reason we looked at autism is we had the money to do it looking at an individual is about 3,000 dollars and the parent of a child with asperger 's disease the high-intelligence autism had sent his thing to a conventional company they did n't do it could n't do it by conventional genetics but just scanning it we began to find genes for autism and you can see here there are a lot of them so a lot of autistic kids are autistic because they just lost a big piece of dna i mean big piece at the molecular level we saw one autistic kid about five million bases just missing from one of his chromosomes we have n't yet looked at the parents but the parents probably do n't have that loss or they would n't be parents now so our autism study is just beginning we got three million dollars i think it will cost at least 10 to 20 before you 'd be in a position to help parents who 've had an autistic child or think they may have an autistic child and can we spot the difference so this same technique should probably look at all it 's a wonderful way to find genes and so i 'll conclude by saying we 've looked at 20 people with schizophrenia and we thought we 'd probably have to look at several hundred before we got the picture but as you can see there 's seven out of 20 had a change which was very high and yet in the controls there were three so what 's the meaning of the controls were they crazy also and we did n't know it or you know were they normal i would guess they 're normal and what we think in schizophrenia is there are genes of predisposure and whether this is one that predisposes [UNK] and then there 's only a sub-segment of the population that 's capable of being schizophrenic now we do n't have really any evidence of it but i think to give you a hypothesis the best guess is that if you 're left-handed you 're prone to schizophrenia 30 percent of schizophrenic people are left-handed and schizophrenia has a very funny genetics which means 60 percent of the people are genetically left-handed but only half of it showed i do n't have the time to say now some people who think they 're right-handed are genetically left-handed ok i 'm just saying that if you think oh i do n't carry a left-handed gene so therefore my you know children wo n't be at risk of schizophrenia you might ok so it 's to me an extraordinarily exciting time we ought to be able to find the gene for bipolar there 's a relationship and if i had enough money we 'd find them all this year i thank you .i 'm a historian steve told us about the future of little technology i 'm going to show you some of the past of big technology this was a project to build a 4,000-ton nuclear bomb-propelled spaceship and go to saturn and jupiter this took place in my childhood [UNK] 1957 to '65 it was deeply classified i 'm going to show you some stuff that not only has not been declassified but has now been reclassified if all goes well next year i 'll be back and i 'll have a lot more to show you and if all does n't go well i 'll be in jail like wen ho lee so this ship was basically the size of the marriott hotel a little taller and a little bigger and one of the people who worked on it in the beginning was my father freeman there in the middle that 's me and my sister esther who 's a frequent tedster i did n't like nuclear bomb-propelled spaceships i mean i thought it was a great idea but i started building kayaks so we had a few kayaks just so you know i am not dr. strangelove but all the time i was out there doing these strange kayak voyages in odd beautiful parts of this planet i always thought in the back of my mind about project orion and how my father and his friends were going to build these big ships they were really going to go they were actually going to go ted taylor who led the project was going to take his children my father was not going to take his children that was one of the reasons we sort of had a falling out for a few years the project began in '57 at general atomics there that 's right on the coast at la jolla look at that central building right in the middle of the picture that 's the 130-foot diameter library that is exactly the size of the base of the spaceship so put that library at the bottom of that ship [UNK] that 's how big the thing was going to be it would take 2,000 or 3,000 bombs the people who worked on it were a lot of the los alamos people who had done the hydrogen bomb work it was the first project funded by arpa that 's the contract where arpa gave the first million dollars to get this thing started " spaceship project officially begun job waiting for you dyson " that 's july '58 two days later the space traveler 's manifesto explaining why [UNK] just like we heard yesterday [UNK] why we need to go into space " trips to satellites of the outer planets august 20 1958 " these are the statistics of what would be the good places to go and stop some of the sizes of the ships ranging all the way up to ship mass of 8 million tons so that was the outer extreme here was version two 2,000 bombs these are five kiloton yield bombs about the size of small volkswagens it would take 800 to get into orbit here we see a 10,000 ton ship will deliver 1,300 tons to saturn and back essentially a five year trip possible departure dates october 1960 to february 1967 this is trajectories going to mars all this was done by hand with slide rules the little orion ship and what it would take to do what orion does with chemicals you have a ship the size of the empire state building nasa had no interest they tried to kill the project the people who supported it were the air force which meant that it was all secret and that 's why when you get something declassified that 's what it looks like military weapon versions that were versions that carried hydrogen bombs that could destroy half the planet there 's another version there that sends retaliatory strikes at the soviet union this is the real secret stuff how to get directed energy explosions so you 're sending the energy of a nuclear explosion [UNK] not like just a stick of dynamite but you 're directing it at the ship and this is still a very active subject it 's quite dangerous but i believe it 's better to have dangerous things in the open than think you 're going to keep them secret this is what 's happened at 600 microseconds the air force started to build smaller models and actually started doing this the guys in la jolla said " we 've got to get started now " they built a high-explosive propelled model these are stills from film footage that was saved by someone who was supposed to destroy it but did n't and kept it in their basement for the last 40 years so these are three-pound charges of c4 that 's about 10 times what the guy had in his shoes this is ed day putting 1 so each of these coffee cans has three pounds of c4 in it they 're building a system that ejects these at quarter-second intervals that 's my dad in the sport coat there holding the briefcase so they had a lot of fun doing this but no children were allowed my dad could tell me he was building a spaceship and going to go to saturn but he could not say anything more about it so all my life i have wanted to find this stuff out and spent the last four years tracking these old guys down these are stills from the video jeff bezos kindly yesterday said he 'll put this video up on the amazon site [UNK] some little clip of it so thanks to him they got quite serious about the engineering of this the size of that mass for us is really large technology in a way we 're never going to go back to if you saw the 1959 1 this is what it would feel like in the passenger compartment that 's acceleration profile and pulse system yield we 're looking at 20-kiloton yield for an effect for us of 10 million newtons well here we have a little problem the radiation doses at the crew station 700 rads per shot fission yields during development they were hoping to get clean bombs [UNK] they did n't eyeburn this is what happens to the people in miami who are looking up personnel compartment noise that 's not too bad it 's very low frequencies it 's basically like these subwoofers and now we have ground hazard assessments when you have a blow-up on the pad finally at the very end in 1964 nasa steps in and says " ok we 'll support a feasibility study for a small version that could be launched with saturn vs in sections and pieced together " so this is what nasa did getting an eight man version that would go to mars they liked it because the guys who kind of live there would be like " it 's just like living in a submarine " this is crew compartment it switches so what 's upside down is right side up when you go to artificial gravity mode the scientists were still going to go along they would take seven astronauts and seven scientists this is a 20 man version for going to jupiter bunks storm cellars exercise room you know it was going to be a nice long trip the air force version here we have a military version this is the kind of stuff that 's not been declassified just that people managed to sneak home and after you know on their deathbed basically gave me the sort of artist conceptions these are basically powerpoint presentations given to the air force 40 years ago look at the little guys there outside the vehicle and one part of nasa was interested in it but the headquarters in nasa they killed the project so finally at the end we can see the thing followed its sort of design path right up to 1965 and then all those paths came to a halt results none this project is hereby terminated so that 's the end all i can say in closing is we heard yesterday that one of the 10 bad things that could happen to us is an asteroid with our name on it and one of the bad things that could happen to nasa is if that asteroid shows up with our name on it nine months out and everybody says " well what are we going to do " and orion is really one of the only if not the only off-the-shelf technologies that could do something so i 'm going to tell you the good news and the bad news the good news is that nasa has a small secret contingency plan division that is looking at this trying to keep knowledge of orion preserved in the event of such a misfortune maybe keep a few little bombs of plutonium on the side that 's the good news the bad news is when i got in contact with these people to try and get some documents from them they went crazy because i had all this stuff that they do n't have and nasa purchased 1,759 pages of this stuff from me so that 's the state we 're at it 's not very good .good morning let 's look for a minute at the greatest icon of all leonardo da vinci we 're all familiar with his fantastic work [UNK] his drawings his paintings his inventions his writings but we do not know his face thousands of books have been written about him but there 's controversy and it remains about his looks even this well-known portrait is not accepted by many art historians so what do you think is this the face of leonardo da vinci or is n't it let 's find out leonardo was a man that drew everything around him he drew people anatomy plants animals landscapes buildings water everything but no faces i find that hard to believe his contemporaries made faces like the ones you see here [UNK] en face or three-quarters so surely a passionate drawer like leonardo must have made self-portraits from time to time so let 's try to find them i think that if we were to scan all of his work and look for self-portraits we would find his face looking at us so i looked at all of his drawings more than 700 and looked for male portraits there are about 120 you see them here which ones of these could be self-portraits well for that they have to be done as we just saw en face or three-quarters so we can eliminate all the profiles it also has to be sufficiently detailed so we can also eliminate the ones that are very vague or very stylized and we know from his contemporaries that leonardo was a very handsome even beautiful man so we can also eliminate the ugly ones or the caricatures and look what happens [UNK] only three candidates remain that fit the bill and here they are yes indeed the old man is there as is this famous pen drawing of the homo vitruvianus and lastly the only portrait of a male that leonardo painted " the musician " before we go into these faces i should explain why i have some right to talk about them i 've made more than 1,100 portraits myself for newspapers over the course of 300 [UNK] 30 years sorry 30 years only but there are 1,100 and very few artists have drawn so many faces so i know a little about drawing and analyzing faces ok now let 's look at these three portraits and hold onto your seats because if we zoom in on those faces remark how they have the same broad forehead the horizontal eyebrows the long nose the curved lips and the small well-developed chin i could n't believe my eyes when i first saw that there is no reason why these portraits should look alike all we did was look for portraits that had the characteristics of a self-portrait and look they are very similar now are they made in the right order the young man should be made first and as you see here from the years that they were created it is indeed the case they are made in the right order what was the age of leonardo at the time does that fit yes it does he was 33 38 and 63 when these were made so we have three pictures potentially of the same person of the same age as leonardo at the time but how do we know it 's him and not someone else well we need a reference and here 's the only picture of leonardo that 's widely accepted it 's a statue made by verrocchio of david for which leonardo posed as a boy of 15 and if we now compare the face of the statue with the face of the musician you see the very same features again the statue is the reference and it connects the identity of leonardo to those three faces ladies and gentlemen this story has not yet been published it 's only proper that you here at ted hear and see it first the icon of icons finally has a face here he is leonardo da vinci .you all know the truth of what i 'm going to say i think the intuition that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive has been around since before the french revolution what 's changed is we now can look at the evidence we can compare societies more and less equal societies and see what inequality does i 'm going to take you through that data and then explain why the links i 'm going to be showing you exist but first see what a miserable lot we are i want to start though with a paradox this shows you life expectancy against gross national income [UNK] how rich countries are on average and you see the countries on the right like norway and the usa are twice as rich as israel greece portugal on the left and it makes no difference to their life expectancy at all there 's no suggestion of a relationship there but if we look within our societies there are extraordinary social gradients in health running right across society this again is life expectancy these are small areas of england and wales [UNK] the poorest on the right the richest on the left a lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us even the people just below the top have less good health than the people at the top so income means something very important within our societies and nothing between them the explanation of that paradox is that within our societies we 're looking at relative income or social position social status [UNK] where we are in relation to each other and the size of the gaps between us and as soon as you 've got that idea you should immediately wonder what happens if we widen the differences or compress them make the income differences bigger or smaller and that 's what i 'm going to show you i 'm not using any hypothetical data i 'm taking data from the u.n. [UNK] it 's the same as the world bank has [UNK] on the scale of income differences in these rich developed market democracies the measure we 've used because it 's easy to understand and you can download it is how much richer the top 20 percent than the bottom 20 percent in each country and you see in the more equal countries on the left [UNK] japan finland norway sweden [UNK] the top 20 percent are about three and a half four times as rich as the bottom 20 percent but on the more unequal end [UNK] u.k. portugal usa singapore [UNK] the differences are twice as big on that measure we are twice as unequal as some of the other successful market democracies now i 'm going to show you what that does to our societies we collected data on problems with social gradients the kind of problems that are more common at the bottom of the social ladder internationally comparable data on life expectancy on kids ' maths and literacy scores on infant mortality rates homicide rates proportion of the population in prison teenage birthrates levels of trust obesity mental illness [UNK] which in standard diagnostic classification includes drug and alcohol addiction [UNK] and social mobility we put them all in one index they 're all weighted equally where a country is is a sort of average score on these things and there you see it in relation to the measure of inequality i 've just shown you which i shall use over and over again in the data the more unequal countries are doing worse on all these kinds of social problems it 's an extraordinarily close correlation but if you look at that same index of health and social problems in relation to gnp per capita gross national income there 's nothing there no correlation anymore we were a little bit worried that people might think we 'd been choosing problems to suit our argument and just manufactured this evidence so we also did a paper in the british medical journal on the unicef index of child well-being it has 40 different components put together by other people it contains whether kids can talk to their parents whether they have books at home what immunization rates are like whether there 's bullying at school everything goes into it here it is in relation to that same measure of inequality kids do worse in the more unequal societies highly significant relationship but once again if you look at that measure of child well-being in relation to national income per person there 's no relationship no suggestion of a relationship what all the data i 've shown you so far says is the same thing the average well-being of our societies is not dependent any longer on national income and economic growth that 's very important in poorer countries but not in the rich developed world but the differences between us and where we are in relation to each other now matter very much i 'm going to show you some of the separate bits of our index here for instance is trust it 's simply the proportion of the population who agree most people can be trusted it comes from the world values survey you see at the more unequal end it 's about 15 percent of the population who feel they can trust others but in the more equal societies it rises to 60 or 65 percent and if you look at measures of involvement in community life or social capital very similar relationships closely related to inequality i may say we did all this work twice we did it first on these rich developed countries and then as a separate test bed we repeated it all on the 50 american states [UNK] asking just the same question do the more unequal states do worse on all these kinds of measures so here is trust from a general social survey of the federal government related to inequality very similar scatter over a similar range of levels of trust same thing is going on basically we found that almost anything that 's related to trust internationally is related to trust amongst the 50 states in that separate test bed we 're not just talking about a fluke this is mental illness who put together figures using the same diagnostic interviews on random samples of the population to allow us to compare rates of mental illness in each society this is the percent of the population with any mental illness in the preceding year and it goes from about eight percent up to three times that [UNK] whole societies with three times the level of mental illness of others and again closely related to inequality this is violence these red dots are american states and the blue triangles are canadian provinces but look at the scale of the differences it goes from 15 homicides per million up to 150 this is the proportion of the population in prison there 's a about a tenfold difference there log scale up the side but it goes from about 40 to 400 people in prison that relationship is not mainly driven by more crime in some places that 's part of it but most of it is about more punitive sentencing harsher sentencing and the more unequal societies are more likely also to retain the death penalty here we have children dropping out of high school again quite big differences extraordinarily damaging if you 're talking about using the talents of the population this is social mobility it 's actually a measure of mobility based on income basically it 's asking do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons or is there no relationship between the two and at the more unequal end fathers ' income is much more important [UNK] in the u.k. usa and in scandinavian countries fathers ' income is much less important there 's more social mobility and as we like to say [UNK] and i know there are a lot of americans in the audience here [UNK] if americans want to live the american dream they should go to denmark i 've shown you just a few things in italics here i could have shown a number of other problems they 're all problems that tend to be more common at the bottom of the social gradient but there are endless problems with social gradients that are worse in more unequal countries [UNK] not just a little bit worse but anything from twice as common to 10 times as common think of the expense the human cost of that i want to go back though to this graph that i showed you earlier where we put it all together to make two points one is that in graph after graph we find the countries that do worse whatever the outcome seem to be the more unequal ones and the ones that do well seem to be the nordic countries and japan so what we 're looking at is general social disfunction related to inequality it 's not just one or two things that go wrong it 's most things the other really important point i want to make on this graph is that if you look at the bottom sweden and japan they 're very different countries in all sorts of ways the position of women how closely they keep to the nuclear family are on opposite ends of the poles in terms of the rich developed world but another really important difference is how they get their greater equality sweden has huge differences in earnings and it narrows the gap through taxation general welfare state generous benefits and so on japan is rather different though it starts off with much smaller differences in earnings before tax it has lower taxes it has a smaller welfare state and in our analysis of the american states we find rather the same contrast there are some states that do well through redistribution some states that do well because they have smaller income differences before tax so we conclude that it does n't much matter how you get your greater equality as long as you get there somehow i am not talking about perfect equality i 'm talking about what exists in rich developed market democracies another really surprising part of this picture is that it 's not just the poor who are affected by inequality there seems to be some truth in john donne 's " no man is an island " and in a number of studies it 's possible to compare how people do in more and less equal countries at each level in the social hierarchy this is just one example it 's infant mortality some swedes very kindly classified a lot of their infant deaths according to the british register of general socioeconomic classification and so it 's anachronistically a classification by fathers ' occupations so single parents go on their own but then where it says " low social class " that 's unskilled manual occupations it goes through towards the skilled manual occupations in the middle then the junior non-manual going up high to the professional occupations [UNK] doctors lawyers directors of larger companies you see there that sweden does better than britain all the way across the social hierarchy the biggest differences are at the bottom of society but even at the top there seems to be a small benefit to being in a more equal society we show that on about five different sets of data covering educational outcomes and health in the united states and internationally and that seems to be the general picture [UNK] that greater equality makes most difference at the bottom but has some benefits even at the top but i should say a few words about what 's going on i think i 'm looking and talking about the psychosocial effects of inequality more to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority of being valued and devalued respected and disrespected and of course those feelings of the status competition that comes out of that drives the consumerism in our society it also leads to status insecurity we worry more about how we 're judged and seen by others whether we 're regarded as attractive clever all that kind of thing the social-evaluative judgments increase the fear of those social-evaluative judgments interestingly some parallel work going on in social psychology some people reviewed 208 different studies in which volunteers had been invited into a psychological laboratory and had their stress hormones their responses to doing stressful tasks measured and in the review what they were interested in seeing is what kind of stresses most reliably raise levels of cortisol the central stress hormone and the conclusion was it was tasks that included social-evaluative threat [UNK] threats to self-esteem or social status in which others can negatively judge your performance those kind of stresses have a very particular effect on the physiology of stress now we have been criticized of course there are people who dislike this stuff and people who find it very surprising i should tell you though that when people criticize us for picking and choosing data we never pick and choose data we have an absolute rule that if our data source has data for one of the countries we 're looking at it goes into the analysis our data source decides whether it 's reliable data we do n't otherwise that would introduce bias what about other countries there are 200 studies of health in relation to income and equality in the academic peer-reviewed journals this is n't confined to these countries here hiding a very simple demonstration the same countries the same measure of inequality one problem after another why do n't we control for other factors well we 've shown you that gnp per capita does n't make any difference and of course others using more sophisticated methods in the literature have controlled for poverty and education and so on what about causality correlation in itself does n't prove causality we spend a good bit of time and indeed people know the causal links quite well in some of these outcomes the big change in our understanding of drivers of chronic health in the rich developed world is how important chronic stress from social sources is affecting the immune system the cardiovascular system or for instance the reason why violence becomes more common in more unequal societies is because people are sensitive to being looked down on i should say that to deal with this we 've got to deal with the post-tax things and the pre-tax things we 've got to constrain income the bonus culture incomes at the top i think we must make our bosses accountable to their employees in any way we can i think the take-home message though is that we can improve the real quality of human life by reducing the differences in incomes between us suddenly we have a handle on the psychosocial well-being of whole societies and that 's exciting thank you .i went to spain a few months ago and i had the best foie gras of my life the best culinary experience of my life because what i saw i 'm convinced is the future of cooking ridiculous right foie gras and the future of cooking there 's not a food today that 's more maligned than foie gras right i mean it 's crucified it was outlawed in chicago for a while it 's pending here in california and just recently in new york it 's like if you 're a chef and you put it on your menu you risk being attacked really it happened here in san francisco to a famous chef i 'm not saying that there 's not a rationale for being opposed to foie gras the reasons usually just boil down to the gavage which is the force feeding basically you take a goose or a duck and you force feed a ton of grain down its throat more grain in a couple of weeks than it would ever get in a lifetime its liver expands by eight times suffice to say it 's like [UNK] it 's not the prettiest picture of sustainable farming the problem for us chefs is that it 's so freakin ' delicious i mean i love the stuff it is fatty it 's sweet it 's silky it 's unctuous it makes everything else you put it with taste incredible can we produce a menu that 's delicious without foie gras yes sure you can also bike the tour de france without steroids right not a lot of people are doing it and for good reason so several months ago a friend of mine sent me this link to this guy eduardo sousa eduardo is doing what he calls natural foie gras natural foie gras what 's natural about foie gras to take advantage of when the temperature drops in the fall geese and ducks gorge on food to prepare for the harsh realities of winter and the rest of the year they 're free to roam around eduardo 's land and eat what they want so no gavage no force feeding no factory-like conditions no cruelty and it 's shockingly not a new idea his great-granddad started [UNK] patería de sousa [UNK] in 1812 and they 've been doing it quietly ever since that is until last year when eduardo won the coup de coeur the coveted french gastronomic prize it 's like the olympics of food products he placed first for his foie gras big big problem as he said to me that really pissed the french off he said it sort of gleefully it was all over the papers i read about it it was in le monde " spanish chef accused 1 " [UNK] and the french accused him " spanish chef accused of cheating " they accused him of paying off the judges they implicated actually the spanish government amazingly huh amazing a huge scandal for a few weeks could n't find a shred of evidence now look at the guy he does n't look like a guy who 's paying off french judges for his foie gras so that died down and very soon afterward new controversy he should n't win because it 's not foie gras it 's not foie gras because it 's not gavage there 's no force feeding so by definition he 's lying and should be disqualified as funny as it sounds articulating it now and reading about it [UNK] actually if we had talked about it before this controversy i would have said " that 's kind of true " you know foie gras by definition force feeding it 's gavage and that 's what you get when you want foie gras that is until i went to eduardo 's farm in extremadura 50 miles north of seville right on the portugal border i saw first-hand a system that is incredibly complex and then at the same time like everything beautiful in nature is utterly simple and he said to me really from the first moment my life 's work is to give the geese what they want he repeated that about 50 times in the two days i was with him i 'm just here to give the geese what they want actually when i showed up he was lying down with the geese with his cell phone taking pictures of them like his children in the grass amazing he 's really just in love with [UNK] he 's at one with [UNK] he 's the goose whisperer and when i was speaking to him you know i thought like i 'm speaking to you now right but sort of in the middle of my questions my excited questions because the more i got to know him and his system the more exciting this whole idea became he kept going like this to me and i thought ok excited jew from new york right i 'm talking a little too aggressively whatever so you know i slowed down and finally by the end of the day i was like ed-uar-do you know like this but he was still going like this i figured it out i was speaking too loudly so i hushed my voice i kind of like asked these questions and chatted with him through a translator in kind of a half whisper and he stopped doing this and amazingly the geese who were on the other side of the paddock when i was around [UNK] " get the hell away from this kid 1 " [UNK] when i lowered my voice they all came right up to us right up to us like right up to here right along the fence line and fence line was amazing in itself the fence [UNK] like this conception of fence that we have it 's totally backward with him the electricity on this fiberglass fence is only on the outside he rewired it he invented it i 've never seen it have you you fence in animals you electrify the inside he does n't he electrifies only the outside why because he said to me that he felt like the geese [UNK] and he proved this actually not just a conceit he proved this [UNK] the geese felt manipulated when they were imprisoned in their little paddocks even though they were imprisoned in this garden of eden with figs and everything else he felt like they felt manipulated so he got rid of the electricity he got rid of current on the inside and kept it on the outside so it would protect them against coyotes and other predators now what happened they ate and he showed me on a chart how they ate about 20 percent more feed to feed their livers the landscape is incredible i mean his farm is incredible it really is the garden of eden there 's figs and everything else there for the taking and the irony of ironies is because extremadura the area [UNK] what does extremadura mean extra hard land right extra difficult extra hard but over four generations he and his family have literally transformed this extra hard land into a tasting menu upgrades the life for these geese and they are allowed to take whatever they want another irony the double irony is that on the figs and the olives eduardo can make more money selling those than he can on the foie gras he does n't care he lets them take what they want and he says " usually it 's about 50 percent they 're very fair " the other 50 percent he takes and he sells and he makes money on them part of the income for his farm a big part of his income for his farm but he never controls it they get what they want they leave the rest for me and i sell it his biggest obstacle really was the marketplace which demands these days bright yellow foie gras that 's how i 've been trained you want to look and see what good foie gras is it 's got to be bright yellow it 's the indication that it 's the best foie gras well because he does n't force feed because he does n't gavage tons of corn his livers were pretty grey or they were but he found this wild plant called the lupin bush the lupin bush it 's all around extremadura he let it go to seed he took the seeds he planted it on his 30 acres all around and the geese love the lupin bush not for the bush but for the seeds and when they eat the seeds their foie gras turns yellow radioactive yellow bright yellow of the highest quality foie gras yellow i 've ever seen so i 'm listening to all this you know and i 'm like is this guy for real is he making some of this up is he like you know [UNK] because he seemed to have an answer for everything and it was always nature it was never him and i was like you know i always get a little like weirded out by people who deflect everything away from themselves because really they want you to look at themselves right but he deflected everything away from his ingenuity into working with his landscape so it 's like here i am i 'm on the fence about this guy but increasingly eating up his every word and we 're sitting there and i hear [ clapping ] from a distance so i look over and he grabs my arm and the translator 's and ducks us under a bush and says " watch this " " shush " he says again for the 500th time to me " shush watch this " and this squadron of geese come over [ clapping ] and they 're getting louder louder louder like really loud right over us and like airport traffic control as they start to go past us they 're called back [UNK] and they 're called back and back and back and then they circle around and his geese are calling up now to the wild geese [ clapping ] and the wild geese are calling down [ clapping ] and it 's getting louder and louder and they circle and circle and they land and i 'm just saying " no way " no way and i look at eduardo who 's near tears looking at this and i say " you 're telling me that your geese are calling to the wild geese to say come for a visit " and he says " no no no they 've come to stay " they 've come to stay it 's like the dna of a goose is to fly south in the winter right i said that i said " is n't that what they 're put on this earth for to fly south in the winter and north when it gets warm " he said " no no no their dna is to find the conditions that are conducive to life to happiness they find it here they do n't need anything more " they stop they mate with his domesticated geese and his flock continues think about that for a minute it 's brilliant right imagine [UNK] i do n't know imagine a hog farm in like north carolina and a wild pig comes upon a factory farm and decides to stay so how did it taste i finally got to taste it before i left he took me to his neighborhood restaurant and he served me some of his foie gras confit de foie gras it was incredible and the problem with saying that of course is that you know at this point it risks hyperbole really easily and i 'd like to make a metaphor but i do n't have one really i was drinking this guy 's kool-aid so much he could have served me goose feathers and i would have been like this guy 's a genius you know i 'm really in love with him at this point but it truly was the best foie gras of my life so much so that i do n't think i had ever really had foie gras until that moment i 'd had something that was called foie gras but this was transformative really transformative and i say to you i might not stick to this but i do n't think i 'll ever serve foie gras on my menu again because of that taste experience with eduardo it was sweet it was unctuous it had all the qualities of foie gras but its fat had a lot of integrity and a lot of honesty and you could taste herbs you could taste spices and i kept [UNK] i said you know i swear to god i tasted star anise i was sure of it and i 'm not like some super taster you know but i can taste things there 's 100 percent star anise in there and he says " no " and i ended up like going down the spices and finally it was like ok salt and pepper thinking he 's salted and peppered his liver but no he takes the liver when he harvests the foie gras he sticks them in this jar and he confits it no salt no pepper no oil no spices what we went back out for the final tour of the farm and he showed me the wild pepper plants and the plants that he made sure existed on his farm for salinity he does n't need salt and pepper and he does n't need spices because he 's got this potpourri of herbs and flavors that his geese love to gorge on i turned to him at the end of the meal and it 's a question i asked several times and he had n't kind of answered me directly but i said " now look you 're in spain some of the greatest chefs in the world are [UNK] ferran adria the preeminent chef of the world today not that far from you how come you do n't give him this how come no one 's really heard of you " and it may be because of the wine or it may be because of my excitement he answered me directly and he said " because chefs do n't deserve my foie gras " and he was right he was right chefs take foie gras and they make it their own they create a dish where all the vectors point at us with eduardo it 's about the expression of nature and as he said i think fittingly it 's a gift from god with god saying you 've done good work simple i flew home i 'm on the flight with my little black book and i took you know pages and pages of notes about it i really was moved and in the corner of one of these [UNK] one of my notes is this note that says when asked what do you think of conventional foie gras what do you think of foie gras that 99.99999 percent of the world eats he said " i think it 's an insult to history " and i wrote insult to history i 'm on the plane and i 'm just tearing my hair out it 's like why did n't i follow up on that what the hell does that mean insult to history so i did some research when i got back and here 's what i found the history of foie gras jews invented foie gras true story true story by accident they were looking for an alternative to schmaltz gotten sick of the chicken fat they were looking for an alternative and they saw in the fall that there was this natural beautiful sweet delicious fat from geese and they slaughtered them used the fat throughout the winter for cooking the pharaoh got wind of this [UNK] this is true right off the internet the pharaoh got [UNK] i swear to god the pharaoh got wind of this and wanted to taste it he tasted it and fell in love with it he started demanding it and he did n't want it just in the fall he wanted it all year round and he demanded that the jews supply enough for everyone and the jews fearing for their life had to come up with an ingenious idea or at least try and satisfy the pharaoh 's wishes of course and they invented what gavage they invented gavage in a great moment of fear for their lives and they provided the pharaoh with gavage liver and the good stuff they kept for themselves supposedly anyway i believe that one that 's the history of foie gras and if you think about it it 's the history of industrial agriculture it 's the history of what we eat today most of what we eat today mega-farms feed lots chemical amendments long-distance travel food processing all of it our food system that 's also an insult to history it 's an insult to the basic laws of nature and of biology whether we 're talking about beef cattle or we 're talking about chickens or we 're talking about broccoli or brussels sprouts or in the case of this morning 's new york times catfish [UNK] which wholesale are going out of business whatever it is it 's a mindset that is reminiscent of general motors it 's rooted in extraction take more sell more waste more and for the future it wo n't serve us jonas salk has a great quote he said " if all the insects disappeared life on earth as we know it would disappear within 50 years if human beings disappeared life on earth as we know it would flourish " and he 's right we need now to adopt a new conception of agriculture really new one in which we stop treating the planet as if it were some kind of business in liquidation and stop degrading resources under the guise of cheap food we can start by looking to farmers like eduardo farmers that rely on nature for solutions for answers rather than imposing solutions on nature listening as janine benyus one of my favorite writers and thinkers about this topic says " listening to nature 's operating instructions " that 's what eduardo does and does so brilliantly and what he showed me and what he can show all of us i think is that the great thing for chefs the great blessing for chefs and for people that care about food and cooking is that the most ecological choice for food is also the most ethical choice for food whether we 're talking about brussels sprouts or foie gras and it 's also almost always and i have n't found an example otherwise but almost always the most delicious choice that 's serendipitous thank you .so i 'm going to tell you a little bit about reimagining food i 've been interested in food for a long time i taught myself to cook with a bunch of big books like this i went to chef school in france and there is a way the world both envisions food the way the world writes about food and learns about food and it 's largely what you would find in these books and it 's a wonderful thing but there 's some things that have been going on since this idea of food was established in the last 20 years people have realized that science has a tremendous amount to do with food in fact understanding why cooking works requires knowing the science of cooking [UNK] some of the chemistry some of the physics and so forth but that 's not in any of those books there 's also a tremendous number of techniques that chefs have developed some about new aesthetics new approaches to food there 's a chef in spain named ferran adria he 's developed a very avant-garde cuisine a guy in england called heston blumenthal he 's developed his avant-garde cuisine none of the techniques that these people have developed over the course of the last 20 years is in any of those books none of them are taught in cooking schools in order to learn them you have to go work in those restaurants and finally there 's the old way of viewing food is the old way and so a few years ago [UNK] fours years ago actually [UNK] i set out to say is there a way we can communicate science and technique and wonder is there a way we can show people food in a way they have not seen it before so we tried and i 'll show you what we came up with this is a picture called a cutaway this is actually the first picture i took in the book the idea here is to explain what happens when you steam broccoli and this magic view allows you to see all of what 's happening while the broccoli steams then each of the different little pieces around it explain some fact and the hope was two-fold one is you can actually explain what happens when you steam broccoli but the other thing is that maybe we could seduce people into stuff that was a little more technical maybe a little bit more scientific maybe a little bit more chef-y than they otherwise would have because with that beautiful photo maybe i can also package this little box here that talks about how steaming and boiling actually take different amounts of time steaming ought to be faster it turns out it is n't because of something called film condensation and this explains that well that first cutaway picture worked so we said " okay let 's do some more " so here 's another one we discovered why woks are the shape they are this shaped wok does n't work very well this caught fire three times but we had a philosophy which is it only has to look good for a thousandth of a second and one of our canning cutaways once you start cutting things in half you kind of get carried away so you see we cut the jars in half as well as the pan and each of these text blocks explains a key thing that 's going on in this case boiling water canning is for canning things that are already pretty acidic you do n't have to heat them up as hot as you would something you do pressure canning because bacterial spores ca n't grow in the acid so this is great for pickled vegetables which is what we 're canning here here 's our hamburger cutaway one of our philosophies in the book is that no dish is really intrinsically any better than any other dish so you can lavish all the same care all the same technique on a hamburger as you would on some much more fancy dish and if you do lavish as much technique as possible and you try to make the highest quality hamburger it gets to be a little bit involved the new york times ran a piece after my book was delayed and it was called " the wait for the 30-hour hamburger just got longer " because our hamburger recipe our ultimate hamburger recipe if you make the buns and you marinate the meat and you do all this stuff it does take about 30 hours of course you 're not actually working the whole time most of the time is kind of sitting there the point of this cutaway is to show people a view of hamburgers they have n't seen before and to explain the physics of hamburgers and the chemistry of hamburgers because believe it or not there is something to the physics and chemistry [UNK] in particular those flames underneath the burger most of the characteristic char-grilled taste does n't come from the wood or the charcoal buying mesquite charcoal will not actually make that much difference mostly it comes from fat pyrolyzing or burning so it 's the fat that drips down and flares up that causes the characteristic taste now you might wonder how do we make these cutaways most people assume we use photoshop and the answer is no not really we use a machine shop and it turns out the best way to cut things in half is to actually cut them in half so we have two halves of one of the best kitchens in the world we cut a $ 5,000 restaurant oven in half the manufacturer said " what would it take for you to cut one in half " i said " it would have to show up free " and so it showed up we used it a little while we cut it in half now you can also see a little bit how we did some of these shots we would glue a piece of pyrex or heat-resistant glass in front we used a red very high-temperature silicon to do that the great thing is when you cut something in half you have another half so you photograph that in exactly the same position and then you can substitute in [UNK] and that part does use photoshop [UNK] just the edges so it 's very much like in a hollywood movie where a guy flies through the air supported by wires and then they take the wires away digitally so you 're flying through the air in most cases though there was no glass like for the hamburger we just cut the damn barbecue and so those coals that kept falling off the edge we kept having to put them back up but again it only has to work for a thousandth of a second the wok shot caught fire three times what happens when you have your wok cut in half is the oil goes down into the fire and whoosh 1 one of our cooks lost his eyebrows that way but hey they grow back in addition to cutaways we also explain physics this is fourier 's law of heat conduction it 's a partial differential equation we have the only cookbook in the world that has partial differential equations in it but to make them palatable we cut it out of a steel plate and put it in front of a fire and photographed it like this we 've got lots of little tidbits in the book everybody knows that your various appliances have wattage right but you probably do n't know that much about james watt but now you will we put a biography of james watt in it 's a little couple paragraphs to explain why we call that unit of heat the watt and where he got his inspiration it turned out he was hired by a scottish distillery to understand why they were burning so damn much peat to distill the whiskey we also did a lot of calculation i personally wrote thousands of lines of code to write this cookbook here 's a calculation that shows how the intensity of a barbecue or other radiant heat source goes as you move away from it so as you move vertically away from this surface the heat falls off as you move side to side it moves off that horn-shaped region is what we call the sweet spot that 's the place where the heat is even to within 10 percent so that 's the place where you really want to cook and it 's got this funny horn-shaped thing which as far as i know again the first cookbook to ever do this now it may also be the last cookbook that ever does it you know there 's two ways you can make a product you can do lots of market research and do focus groups and figure out what people really want or you can just kind of go for it and make the book you want and hope other people like it here 's a step-by-step that shows grinding hamburger if you really want great hamburger it turns out it makes a difference if you align the grain and it 's really simple as you can see here as it comes out of the grinder you just have a little tray and you just take it off in little passes build it up slice it vertically here 's the final hamburger this is the 30-hour hamburger we make every aspect of this burger the lettuce has got liquid smoke infused into it we also have things about how to make the bun there 's a mushroom ketchup [UNK] it goes on and on now watch closely this is popcorn i 'll explain it here the popcorn is illustrating a key thing in physics is n't that beautiful we have a very high-speed camera which we had lots of fun with on the book the key physics principle here is when water boils to steam it expands by a factor of 1,600 that 's what 's happening to the water inside that popcorn so it 's a great illustration of that now i 'm going to close with a video that is kind of unusual we have a chapter on gels and because people watch mythbusters and csi i thought well let 's put in a recipe for a ballistics gelatin well if you have a high-speed camera and you have a block of ballistics gelatin lying around pretty soon somebody does this now the amazing thing here is that a ballistics gelatin is supposed to mimic what happens to human flesh when you get shot [UNK] that 's why you should n't get shot the other amazing thing is when this ballistics gelatin comes down it falls back down as a nice block anyway here 's the book here it is 2,438 pages and they 're nice big pages too a friend of mine complained that this was too big and too pretty to go in the kitchen so there 's a sixth volume that has washable waterproof paper .imagine if you will [UNK] a gift i 'd like for you to picture it in your mind it 's not too big [UNK] about the size of a golf ball so envision what it looks like all wrapped up but before i show you what 's inside i will tell you it 's going to do incredible things for you it will bring all of your family together you will feel loved and appreciated like never before and reconnect with friends and acquaintances you have n't heard from in years adoration and admiration will overwhelm you it will recalibrate what 's most important in your life it will redefine your sense of spirituality and faith you 'll have a new understanding and trust in your body you 'll have unsurpassed vitality and energy you 'll expand your vocabulary meet new people and you 'll have a healthier lifestyle and get this [UNK] you 'll have an eight-week vacation of doing absolutely nothing you 'll eat countless gourmet meals flowers will arrive by the truckload people will say to you " you look great have you had any work done " and you 'll have a lifetime supply of good drugs you 'll be challenged inspired motivated and humbled your life will have new meaning peace health serenity happiness nirvana the price $ 55,000 and that 's an incredible deal by now i know you 're dying to know what it is and where you can get one does amazon carry it does it have the apple logo on it is there a waiting list not likely this gift came to me about five months ago it looked more like this when it was all wrapped up [UNK] not quite so pretty and this and then this it was a rare gem [UNK] a brain tumor hemangioblastoma [UNK] the gift that keeps on giving and while i 'm okay now i would n't wish this gift for you i 'm not sure you 'd want it but i would n't change my experience it profoundly altered my life in ways i did n't expect in all the ways i just shared with you so the next time you 're faced with something that 's unexpected unwanted and uncertain consider that it just may be a gift .i am a cultural omnivore one whose daily commute is made possible by attachment to an ipod [UNK] an ipod that contains wagner and mozart pop diva christina aguilera country singer josh turner gangsta rap artist kirk franklin concerti symphonies and more and more i 'm a voracious reader a reader who deals with ian mcewan down to stephanie meyer i have read the " twilight " tetralogy and one who lives for my home theater a home theater where i devour dvds video-on-demand and a lot of television for me " law and order svu " tine fey and " 30 rock " and " judge judy " [UNK] " the people are real the cases are real the rulings are final " now i 'm convinced a lot of you probably share my passions especially my passion for judge judy and you 'd fight anybody who attempted to take her away from us but i 'm a little less convinced that you share the central passion of my life a passion for the live professional performing arts performing arts that represent the orchestral repertoire yes but jazz as well modern dance opera theater and more and more and more you know frankly it 's a sector that many of us who work in the field worry is being endangered and possibly dismantled by technology while we initially heralded the internet as the fantastic new marketing device that was going to solve all our problems we now realize that the internet is if anything too effective in that regard depending on who you read an arts organization or an artist who tries to attract the attention of a potential single ticket buyer now competes with between three and 5,000 different marketing messages a typical citizen sees every single day we now know in fact that technology is our biggest competitor for leisure time five years ago gen-x'ers spent 20.7 hours online and tv the majority on tv gen-y'ers spent even more [UNK] 23.8 hours the majority online and now a typical university entering student arrives at college already having spent 20,000 hours online and an additional 10,000 hours playing video games [UNK] a stark reminder that we operate in a cultural context where video games now outsell music and movie recordings combined moreover we 're afraid that technology has altered our very assumptions of cultural consumption thanks to the internet we believe we can get anything we want whenever we want it delivered to our own doorstep we can shop at three in the morning or eight at night ordering jeans tailor-made for our unique body-types expectations of personalization and customization that the live performing arts [UNK] which have set curtain times set venues attendant inconveniences of travel parking and the like [UNK] simply can not meet and we 're all acutely aware what 's it going to mean in the future when we ask someone to pay a hundred dollars for a symphony opera or ballet ticket when that cultural consumer is used to downloading on the internet 24 hours a day for 99 cents a song or for free these are enormous questions for those of us who work in this terrain but as particular as they feel to us we know we 're not alone all of us are engaged in a seismic fundamental realignment of culture and communications a realignment that is shaking and decimating the newspaper industry the magazine industry the book and publishing industry and more saddled in the performing arts as we are by antiquated union agreements that inhibit and often prohibit mechanical reproduction and streaming locked into large facilities that were designed to ossify the ideal relationship between artist and audience most appropriate to the 19th century and locked into a business model dependent on high ticket revenues where we charge exorbitant prices many of us shudder in the wake of the collapse of tower records and ask ourselves " are we next " everyone i talk to in performing arts resonates to the words of adrienne rich who in " dreams of a common language " wrote " we are out in a country that has no language no laws whatever we do together is pure invention the maps they gave us are out of date by years " and for those of you who love the arts are n't you glad you invited me here to brighten your day now rather than saying that we 're on the brink of our own annihilation i prefer to believe that we are engaged in a fundamental reformation a reformation like the religious reformation of the 16th century the arts reformation like the religious reformation is spurred in part by technology with indeed the printing press really leading the charge on the religious reformation both reformations were predicated on fractious discussion internal self-doubt and massive realignment of antiquated business models and at heart both reformations i think were asking the questions who 's entitled to practice how are they entitled to practice and indeed do we need anyone to intermediate for us in order to have an experience with a spiritual divine chris anderson someone i trust you all know editor-in-chief of wired magazine and author of " the long tail " really was the first [UNK] for me [UNK] to nail a lot of this he wrote a long time ago you know thanks to the invention of the internet web technology mini-cams and more the means of artistic production have been democratized for the first time in all of human history in the 1930s if any of you wanted to make a movie you had to work for warner brothers or rko because who could afford a movie set and lighting equipment and editing equipment and scoring and more and now who in this room does n't know a 14 year-old hard at work on her second third or fourth movie similarly the means of artistic distribution have been democratized for the first time in human history again in the '30s warner brothers rko did that for you now go to youtube facebook you have worldwide distribution without leaving the privacy of your own bedroom this double impact is occasioning a massive redefinition of the cultural market a time when anyone is a potential author frankly what we 're seeing now in this environment is a massive time when the entire world is changing as we move from a time when audience numbers are plummeting but the number of arts participants people who write poetry who sing songs who perform in church choirs is exploding beyond our wildest imaginations this group others have called the " pro ams " amateur artists doing work at a professional level you see them on youtube in dance competitions film festivals and more they are radically expanding our notions of the potential of an aesthetic vocabulary while they are challenging and undermining the cultural autonomy of our traditional institutions ultimately we now live in a world defined not by consumption but by participation but i want to be clear just as the religious reformation did not spell the end to the formal church or to the priesthood i believe that our artistic institutions will continue to have importance they currently are the best opportunities for artists to have lives of economic dignity [UNK] not opulence [UNK] of dignity and they are the places where artists who deserve and want to work at a certain scale of resources will find a home but to view them as synonymous with the entirety of the arts community is by far too short-sighted and indeed while we 've tended to polarize the amateur from the professional the single most exciting development in the last five to 10 years has been the rise of the professional hybrid artist the professional artist who works not primarily in the concert hall or on the stage but most frequently around women 's rights or human rights or on global warming issues or aids relief for more [UNK] not out of economic necessity but out of a deep organic conviction that the work that she or he is called to do can not be accomplished in the traditional hermetic arts environment today 's dance world is not defined solely by the royal winnipeg ballet or the national ballet of canada but by liz lerman 's dance exchange [UNK] a multi-generational professional dance company whose dancers range in age from 18 to 82 and who work with genomic scientists to embody the dna strand and with nuclear physicists at cern today 's professional theater community is defined not only the shaw and stratford festivals but by the cornerstone theater of los angeles [UNK] a collective of artists that after 911 brought together 10 different religious communities [UNK] the bahia the catholic the muslim the jewish even the native american and the gay and lesbian communities of faith helping them create their own individual plays and one massive play where they explored the differences in their faith and found commonality as an important first step toward cross-community healing today 's performers like rhodessa jones work in women 's prisons helping women prisoners articulate the pain of incarceration while today 's playwrights and directors work with youth gangs to find alternate channels to violence and more and more and more and indeed i think rather than being annihilated the performing arts are posed on the brink of a time when we will be more important than we have ever been you know we 've said for a long time we are critical to the health of the economic communities in your town and absolutely [UNK] i hope you know that every dollar spent on a performing arts ticket in a community generates five to seven additional dollars for the local economy dollars spent in restaurants or on parking at the fabric stores where we buy fabric for costumes the piano tuner who tunes the instruments and more but the arts are going to be more important to economies as we go forward especially in industries we ca n't even imagine yet just as they have been central to the ipod and the computer game industries which few if any of us come have foreseen 10 to 15 years ago business leadership will depend more and more on emotional intelligence the ability to listen deeply to have empathy to articulate change to motivate others [UNK] the very capacities that the arts cultivate with every encounter especially now as we all must confront the fallacy of a market-only orientation uninformed by social conscience we must seize and celebrate the power of the arts to shape our individual and national characters and especially characters of the young people who all too often are subjected to bombardment of sensation rather than digested experience ultimately especially now in this world where we live in a context of regressive and onerous immigration laws in reality tv that thrives on humiliation and in a context of analysis where the thing we hear most repeatedly day-in day-out in the united states in every train station every bus station every plane station is " ladies and gentlemen please report any suspicious behavior or suspicious individuals to the authorities nearest you " when all of these ways we are encouraged to view our fellow human being with hostility and fear and contempt and suspicion the arts whatever they do whenever they call us together invite us to look at our fellow human being with generosity and curiosity god knows if we ever needed that capacity in human history we need it now you know we 're bound together not i think by technology entertainment and design but by common cause we work to promote healthy vibrant societies to ameliorate human suffering to promote a more thoughtful substantive empathic world order i salute all of you as activists in that quest and urge you to embrace and hold dear the arts in your work whatever your purpose may be i promise you the hand of the doris duke charitable foundation is stretched out in friendship for now and years to come and i thank you for your kindness and your patience in listening to me this afternoon thank you and godspeed .so i work in marketing which i love but my first passion was physics a passion brought to me by a wonderful school teacher when i had a little less gray hair so he taught me that physics is cool because it teaches us so much about the world around us and i 'm going to spend the next few minutes trying to convince you that physics can teach us something about marketing so quick show of hands [UNK] who studied some marketing in university who studied some physics in university pretty good and at school okay lots of you so hopefully this will bring back some happy or possibly some slightly disturbing memories so physics and marketing we 'll start with something very simple [UNK] newton 's law " the force equals mass times acceleration " this is something that perhaps turkish airlines should have studied a bit more carefully before they ran this campaign but if we rearrange this formula quickly we can get to acceleration equals force over mass which means that for a larger particle [UNK] a larger mass [UNK] it requires more force to change its direction it 's the same with brands the more massive a brand the more baggage it has the more force is needed to change its positioning and that 's one of the reasons why arthur andersen chose to launch accenture rather than try to persuade the world that andersen 's could stand for something other than accountancy it explains why hoover found it very difficult to persuade the world that it was more than vacuum cleaners and why companies like unilever and p & amp g keep brands separate like ariel and pringles and dove rather than having one giant parent brand so the physics is that the bigger the mass of an object the more force is needed to change its direction the marketing is the bigger a brand the more difficult it is to reposition it so think about a portfolio of brands or maybe new brands for new ventures now who remembers heisenberg 's uncertainty principle getting a little more technical now so this says that it 's impossible by definition to measure exactly the state [UNK] i.e. the position [UNK] and the momentum of a particle because the act of measuring it by definition changes it so to explain that [UNK] if you 've got an elementary particle and you shine a light on it then the photon of light has momentum which knocks the particle so you do n't know where it was before you looked at it by measuring it the act of measurement changes it the act of observation changes it it 's the same in marketing so with the act of observing consumers changes their behavior think about the group of moms who are talking about their wonderful children in a focus group and almost none of them buy lots of junk food and yet mcdonald 's sells hundreds of millions of burgers every year think about the people who are on accompanied shops in supermarkets who stuff their trolleys full of fresh green vegetables and fruit but do n't shop like that any other day and if you think about the number of people who claim in surveys to regularly look for porn on the web it 's very few yet at google we know it 's the number-one searched for category so luckily the science [UNK] no sorry [UNK] the marketing is getting easier luckily with now better point-of-sale tracking more digital media consumption you can measure more what consumers actually do rather than what they say they do so the physics is you can never accurately and exactly measure a particle because the observation changes it the marketing is [UNK] the message for marketing is [UNK] that try to measure what consumers actually do rather than what they say they 'll do or anticipate they 'll do so next the scientific method [UNK] an axiom of physics of all science [UNK] says you can not prove a hypothesis through observation you can only disprove it what this means is you can gather more and more data around a hypothesis or a positioning and it will strengthen it but it will not conclusively prove it and only one contrary data point can blow your theory out of the water so if we take an example [UNK] ptolemy had dozens of data points to support his theory that the planets would rotate around the earth it only took one robust observation from copernicus to blow that idea out of the water and there are parallels for marketing [UNK] you can invest for a long time in a brand but a single contrary observation of that positioning will destroy consumers ' belief take bp [UNK] they spent millions of pounds over many years building up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand but then one little accident think about toyota it was for a long time revered as the most reliable of cars and then they had the big recall incident and tiger woods for a long time the perfect brand ambassador well you know the story so the physics is that you can not prove a hypothesis but it 's easy to disprove it [UNK] any hypothesis is shaky and the marketing is that not matter how much you 've invested in your brand one bad week can undermine decades of good work so be really careful to try and avoid the screw-ups that can undermine your brand and lastly to the slightly obscure world of entropy [UNK] the second law of thermodynamics this says that entropy which is a measure of the disorder of a system will always increase the same is true of marketing if we go back 20 years the one message pretty much controlled by one marketing manager could pretty much define a brand but where we are today things have changed you can get a strong brand image or a message and put it out there like the conservative party did earlier this year with their election poster but then you lose control of it with the kind of digital comment creation and distribution tools that are available now to every consumer it 's impossible to control where it goes your brand starts being dispersed it gets more chaotic it 's out of your control i actually saw him speak [UNK] he did a good job but while this may be unsettling for marketers it 's actually a good thing this distribution of brand energy gets your brand closer to the people more in with the people it makes this distribution of energy a democratizing force which is ultimately good for your brand so the lesson from physics is that entropy will always increase it 's a fundamental law the message for marketing is that your brand is more dispersed you ca n't fight it so embrace it and find a way to work with it so to close my teacher mr. vutter told me that physics is cool and hopefully i 've convinced you that physics can teach all of us even in the world of marketing something special thank you .so security is two different things it 's a feeling and it 's a reality and they 're different you could feel secure even if you 're not and you can be secure even if you do n't feel it really we have two separate concepts mapped onto the same word and what i want to do in this talk is to split them apart [UNK] figuring out when they diverge and how they converge and language is actually a problem here there are n't a lot of good words for the concepts we 're going to talk about so if you look at security from economic terms it 's a trade-off every time you get some security you 're always trading off something whether this is a personal decision [UNK] whether you 're going to install a burglar alarm in your home [UNK] or a national decision [UNK] where you 're going to invade some foreign country [UNK] you 're going to trade off something either money or time convenience capabilities maybe fundamental liberties and the question to ask when you look at a security anything is not whether this makes us safer but whether it 's worth the trade-off you 've heard in the past several years the world is safer because saddam hussein is not in power that might be true but it 's not terribly relevant the question is was it worth it and you can make your own decision and then you 'll decide whether the invasion was worth it that 's how you think about security [UNK] in terms of the trade-off now there 's often no right or wrong here some of us have a burglar alarm system at home and some of us do n't and it 'll depend on where we live whether we live alone or have a family how much cool stuff we have how much we 're willing to accept the risk of theft in politics also there are different opinions a lot of times these trade-offs are about more than just security and i think that 's really important now people have a natural intuition about these trade-offs we make them every day [UNK] last night in my hotel room when i decided to double-lock the door or you in your car when you drove here when we go eat lunch and decide the food 's not poison and we 'll eat it we make these trade-offs again and again multiple times a day we often wo n't even notice them they 're just part of being alive we all do it every species does it imagine a rabbit in a field eating grass and the rabbit 's going to see a fox that rabbit will make a security trade-off " should i stay or should i flee " and if you think about it the rabbits that are good at making that trade-off will tend to live and reproduce and the rabbits that are bad at it will get eaten or starve so you 'd think that us as a successful species on the planet [UNK] you me everybody [UNK] would be really good at making these trade-offs yet it seems again and again that we 're hopelessly bad at it and i think that 's a fundamentally interesting question i 'll give you the short answer the answer is we respond to the feeling of security and not the reality now most of the time that works most of the time feeling and reality are the same certainly that 's true for most of human prehistory we 've developed this ability because it makes evolutionary sense one way to think of it is that we 're highly optimized for risk decisions that are endemic to living in small family groups in the east african highlands in 100,000 b.c 2010 new york not so much now there are several biases in risk perception a lot of good experiments in this and you can see certain biases that come up again and again so i 'll give you four we tend to exaggerate spectacular and rare risks and downplay common risks [UNK] so flying versus driving the unknown is perceived to be riskier than the familiar one example would be people fear kidnapping by strangers when the data supports kidnapping by relatives is much more common this is for children third personified risks are perceived to be greater than anonymous risks [UNK] so bin laden is scarier because he has a name and the fourth is people underestimate risks in situations they do control and overestimate them in situations they do n't control so once you take up skydiving or smoking you downplay the risks if a risk is thrust upon you [UNK] terrorism was a good example [UNK] you 'll overplay it because you do n't feel like it 's in your control there are a bunch of other of these biases these cognitive biases that affect our risk decisions there 's the availability heuristic which basically means we estimate the probability of something by how easy it is to bring instances of it to mind so you can imagine how that works if you hear a lot about tiger attacks there must be a lot of tigers around you do n't hear about lion attacks there are n't a lot of lions around this works until you invent newspapers because what newspapers do is they repeat again and again rare risks i tell people if it 's in the news do n't worry about it because by definition news is something that almost never happens when something is so common it 's no longer news [UNK] car crashes domestic violence [UNK] those are the risks you worry about we 're also a species of storytellers we respond to stories more than data and there 's some basic innumeracy going on i mean the joke " one two three many " is kind of right we 're really good at small numbers one mango two mangoes three mangoes 10,000 mangoes 100,000 mangoes [UNK] it 's still more mangoes you can eat before they rot so one half one quarter one fifth [UNK] we 're good at that one in a million one in a billion [UNK] they 're both almost never so we have trouble with the risks that are n't very common and what these cognitive biases do is they act as filters between us and reality and the result is that feeling and reality get out of whack they get different now you either have a feeling [UNK] you feel more secure than you are there 's a false sense of security or the other way and that 's a false sense of insecurity i write a lot about " security theater " which are products that make people feel secure but do n't actually do anything there 's no real word for stuff that makes us secure but does n't make us feel secure maybe it 's what the cia 's supposed to do for us so back to economics if economics if the market drives security and if people make trade-offs based on the feeling of security then the smart thing for companies to do for the economic incentives are to make people feel secure and there are two ways to do this one you can make people actually secure and hope they notice or two you can make people just feel secure and hope they do n't notice so what makes people notice well a couple of things understanding of the security of the risks the threats the countermeasures how they work but if you know stuff you 're more likely to have your feelings match reality enough real world examples helps now we all know the crime rate in our neighborhood because we live there and we get a feeling about it that basically matches reality security theater 's exposed when it 's obvious that it 's not working properly okay so what makes people not notice well a poor understanding if you do n't understand the risks you do n't understand the costs you 're likely to get the trade-off wrong and your feeling does n't match reality not enough examples there 's an inherent problem with low probability events if for example terrorism almost never happens it 's really hard to judge the efficacy of counter-terrorist measures this is why you keep sacrificing virgins and why your unicorn defenses are working just great there are n't enough examples of failures also feelings that are clouding the issues [UNK] the cognitive biases i talked about earlier fears folk beliefs basically an inadequate model of reality so let me complicate things i have feeling and reality i want to add a third element i want to add model feeling and model in our head reality is the outside world it does n't change it 's real so feeling is based on our intuition model is based on reason that 's basically the difference in a primitive and simple world there 's really no reason for a model because feeling is close to reality you do n't need a model but in a modern and complex world you need models to understand a lot of the risks we face there 's no feeling about germs you need a model to understand them so this model is an intelligent representation of reality it 's of course limited by science by technology we could n't have a germ theory of disease before we invented the microscope to see them it 's limited by our cognitive biases but it has the ability to override our feelings where do we get these models we get them from others we get them from religion from culture teachers elders a couple years ago i was in south africa on safari the tracker i was with grew up in kruger national park he had some very complex models of how to survive and it depended on if you were attacked by a lion or a leopard or a rhino or an elephant [UNK] and when you had to run away and when you could n't run away and when you had to climb a tree [UNK] when you could never climb a tree i would have died in a day but he was born there and he understood how to survive i was born in new york city i could have taken him to new york and he would have died in a day because we had different models based on our different experiences models can come from the media from our elected officials think of models of terrorism child kidnapping airline safety car safety models can come from industry the two i 'm following are surveillance cameras id cards quite a lot of our computer security models come from there a lot of models come from science health models are a great example think of cancer of bird flu swine flu sars all of our feelings of security about those diseases come from models given to us really by science filtered through the media so models can change models are not static as we become more comfortable in our environments our model can move closer to our feelings so an example might be if you go back 100 years ago when electricity was first becoming common there were a lot of fears about it i mean there were people who were afraid to push doorbells because there was electricity in there and that was dangerous for us we 're very facile around electricity we change light bulbs without even thinking about it our model of security around electricity is something we were born into it has n't changed as we were growing up and we 're good at it or think of the risks on the internet across generations [UNK] how your parents approach internet security versus how you do versus how our kids will models eventually fade into the background intuitive is just another word for familiar so as your model is close to reality and it converges with feelings you often do n't know it 's there so a nice example of this came from last year and swine flu when swine flu first appeared the initial news caused a lot of overreaction now it had a name which made it scarier than the regular flu even though it was more deadly and people thought doctors should be able to deal with it so there was that feeling of lack of control and those two things made the risk more than it was as the novelty wore off the months went by there was some amount of tolerance people got used to it there was no new data but there was less fear by autumn people thought the doctors should have solved this already and there 's kind of a bifurcation [UNK] people had to choose between fear and acceptance [UNK] actually fear and indifference [UNK] they kind of chose suspicion and when the vaccine appeared last winter there were a lot of people [UNK] a surprising number [UNK] who refused to get it [UNK] as a nice example of how people 's feelings of security change how their model changes sort of wildly with no new information with no new input this kind of thing happens a lot i 'm going to give one more complication we have feeling model reality i have a very relativistic view of security i think it depends on the observer and most security decisions have a variety of people involved and stakeholders with specific trade-offs will try to influence the decision and i call that their agenda and you see agenda [UNK] this is marketing this is politics [UNK] trying to convince you to have one model versus another trying to convince you to ignore a model and trust your feelings marginalizing people with models you do n't like this is not uncommon an example a great example is the risk of smoking in the history of the past 50 years the smoking risk shows how a model changes and it also shows how an industry fights against a model it does n't like compare that to the secondhand smoke debate [UNK] probably about 20 years behind think about seat belts when i was a kid no one wore a seat belt nowadays no kid will let you drive if you 're not wearing a seat belt compare that to the airbag debate [UNK] probably about 30 years behind all examples of models changing what we learn is that changing models is hard models are hard to dislodge if they equal your feelings you do n't even know you have a model and there 's another cognitive bias i 'll call confirmation bias where we tend to accept data that confirms our beliefs and reject data that contradicts our beliefs so evidence against our model we 're likely to ignore even if it 's compelling it has to get very compelling before we 'll pay attention new models that extend long periods of time are hard global warming is a great example we 're terrible at models that span 80 years we can do to the next harvest we can often do until our kids grow up but 80 years we 're just not good at so it 's a very hard model to accept we can have both models in our head simultaneously right that kind of problem where we 're holding both beliefs together right the cognitive dissonance eventually the new model will replace the old model strong feelings can create a model september 11th created a security model in a lot of people 's heads also personal experiences with crime can do it personal health scare a health scare in the news you 'll see these called flashbulb events by psychiatrists they can create a model instantaneously because they 're very emotive so in the technological world we do n't have experience to judge models and we rely on others we rely on proxies i mean this works as long as it 's to correct others we rely on government agencies to tell us what pharmaceuticals are safe i flew here yesterday i did n't check the airplane i relied on some other group to determine whether my plane was safe to fly we 're here none of us fear the roof is going to collapse on us not because we checked but because we 're pretty sure the building codes here are good it 's a model we just accept pretty much by faith and that 's okay now what we want is people to get familiar enough with better models [UNK] have it reflected in their feelings [UNK] to allow them to make security trade-offs now when these go out of whack you have two options one you can fix people 's feelings directly appeal to feelings it 's manipulation but it can work the second more honest way is to actually fix the model change happens slowly the smoking debate took 40 years and that was an easy one some of this stuff is hard i mean really though information seems like our best hope and i lied remember i said feeling model reality i said reality does n't change it actually does we live in a technological world reality changes all the time so we might have [UNK] for the first time in our species [UNK] feeling chases model model chases reality reality 's moving [UNK] they might never catch up we do n't know but in the long-term both feeling and reality are important and i want to close with two quick stories to illustrate this 1982 [UNK] i do n't know if people will remember this [UNK] there was a short epidemic of tylenol poisonings in the united states it 's a horrific story someone took a bottle of tylenol put poison in it closed it up put it back on the shelf someone else bought it and died this terrified people there were a couple of copycat attacks there was n't any real risk but people were scared and this is how the tamper-proof drug industry was invented those tamper-proof caps that came from this it 's complete security theater as a homework assignment think of 10 ways to get around it i 'll give you one a syringe but it made people feel better it made their feeling of security more match the reality last story a few years ago a friend of mine gave birth i visit her in the hospital it turns out when a baby 's born now they put an rfid bracelet on the baby put a corresponding one on the mother so if anyone other than the mother takes the baby out of the maternity ward an alarm goes off i said " well that 's kind of neat i wonder how rampant baby snatching is out of hospitals " i go home i look it up it basically never happens but if you think about it if you are a hospital and you need to take a baby away from its mother out of the room to run some tests you better have some good security theater or she 's going to rip your arm off so it 's important for us those of us who design security who look at security policy or even look at public policy in ways that affect security it 's not just reality it 's feeling and reality what 's important is that they be about the same it 's important that if our feelings match reality we make better security trade-offs thank you .i 'm really really excited to be here today because i 'm about to show you some stuff that 's just ready to come out of the lab literally and i 'm really glad that you guys are going to be amongst the first to be able to see it in person because i really really think this is going to change [UNK] really change [UNK] the way we interact with machines from this point on now this is a rear-projected drafting table it 's about 36 inches wide and it 's equipped with a multi-touch sensor now normal touch sensors that you see like on a kiosk or interactive whiteboards can only register one point of contact at a time this thing allows you to have multiple points at the same time they can use both my hands i can use chording actions i can just go right up and use all 10 fingers if i wanted to you know like that now multi-touch sensing is n't completely new i mean people like bill buxton have been playing around with it in the '80s however the approach i built here is actually high-resolution low-cost and probably most importantly very scalable so the technology you know is n't the most exciting thing here right now other than probably its newfound accessibility what 's really interesting here is what you can do with it and the kind of interfaces you can build on top of it so let 's see so for instance we have a lava lamp application here now you can see i can use both of my hands to kind of squeeze together and put the blobs together i can inject heat into the system here or i can pull it apart with two of my fingers it 's completely intuitive there 's no instruction manual the interface just kind of disappears this started out as kind of a screensaver app that one of the ph.d. students in our lab ilya rosenberg made but i think its true identity comes out here now what 's great about a multi-touch sensor is that you know i could be doing this with as many fingers here but of course multi-touch also inherently means multi-user so chris could be out here interacting with another part of lava while i kind of play around with it here you can imagine a new kind of sculpting tool where i 'm kind of warming something up making it malleable and then letting it cool down and solidifying in a certain state google should have something like this in their lobby i 'll show you something [UNK] a little more of a concrete example here as this thing loads this is a photographer 's light box application again i can use both of my hands to interact and move photos around but what 's even cooler is that if i have two fingers i can actually grab a photo and then stretch it out like that really easily i can pan zoom and rotate it effortlessly i can do that grossly with both of my hands or i can do it just with two fingers on each of my hands together if i grab the canvas i can kind of do the same thing [UNK] stretch it out i can do it simultaneously where i 'm holding this down and gripping on another one stretching this out like this again the interface just disappears here there 's no manual this is exactly what you expect especially if you have n't interacted with a computer before now when you have initiatives like the $ 100 laptop i kind of cringe at the idea that we 're going to introduce a whole new generation of people to computing with this standard mouse-and-windows-pointer interface this is something that i think is really the way we should be interacting with machines from this point on now of course i can bring up a keyboard and i can bring that around put that up there now obviously this is kind of a standard keyboard but of course i can rescale it to make it work well for my hands and that 's really important because there 's no reason in this day and age that we should be conforming to a physical device that leads to bad things like rsi we have so much technology nowadays that these interfaces should start conforming to us there 's so little applied now to actually improving the way we interact with interfaces from this point on this keyboard is probably actually the really wrong direction to go you can imagine in the future as we develop this kind of technology a keyboard that kind of automatically drifts as your hand moves away and really intelligently anticipates which key you 're trying to stroke with your hands so [UNK] again is n't this great audience where 's your lab jeff han i 'm a research scientist at nyu in new york here 's an example of another kind of app i can make these little fuzz balls it 'll remember the strokes i 'm making of course i can do it with all my hands it 's pressure-sensitive you can notice but what 's neat about that is again i showed you that two-finger gesture that allows you to zoom in really quickly because you do n't have to switch to a hand tool or the magnifying glass tool you can just continuously make things in real multiple scales all at the same time i can create big things out here but i can go back and really quickly go back to where i started and make even smaller things here now this is going to be really important as we start getting to things like data visualization for instance i think we all really enjoyed hans rosling 's talk and he really emphasized the fact that i 've been thinking about for a long time too we have all this great data but for some reason it 's just sitting there we 're not really accessing it and one of the reasons why i think that is is because [UNK] we 'll be helped by things like graphics and visualization and inference tools but i also think a big part of it is going to be starting to be able to have better interfaces to be able to drill down into this kind of data while still thinking about the big picture here let me show you another app here this is something called worldwind it 's done by nasa it 's a kind of [UNK] we 've all seen google earth this is an open-source version of that there are plug-ins to be able to load in different data sets that nasa 's collected over the years but as you can see i can use the same two-fingered gestures to go down and go in really seamlessly there 's no interface again it really allows anybody to kind of go in [UNK] and it just does what you 'd expect you know again there 's just no interface here the interface just disappears i can switch to different data views that 's what 's neat about this app here there you go nasa 's really cool they have these hyper-spectral images that are false-colored so you can [UNK] it 's really good for determining vegetative use well let 's go back to this now the great thing about mapping applications [UNK] it 's not really 2d it 's kind of 3d so again with a multi-point interface you can do a gesture like this [UNK] so you can be able to tilt around like that you know it 's not just simply relegated to a kind of 2d panning and motion now this gesture that we 've developed again is just putting two fingers down [UNK] it 's defining an axis of tilt [UNK] and i can tilt up and down that way that 's something we just came up with on the spot you know it 's probably not the right thing to do but there 's such interesting things you can do with this kind of interface it 's just so much fun playing around with too and so the last thing i want to show you is [UNK] you know i 'm sure we can all think of a lot of entertainment apps that you can do with this thing i 'm a little more interested in the kind of creative applications we can do with this now here 's a simple application here [UNK] i can draw out a curve and when i close it it becomes a character but the neat thing about it is i can add control points and then what i can do is manipulate them with both of my fingers at the same time and you notice what it does it 's kind of a puppeteering thing where i can use as many fingers as i have to draw and make [UNK] now there 's a lot of actual math going on under here for this to control this mesh and do the right thing i mean this technique of being able to manipulate a mesh here with multiple control points is actually something that 's state of the art it was just released at siggraph last year but it 's a great example of the kind of research i really love all this compute power to apply to make things do the right things intuitive things to do exactly what you expect so multi-touch interaction research is a very active field right now in hci i 'm not the only one doing it there are a lot of other people getting into it this kind of technology is going to let even more people get into it and i 'm really looking forward to interacting with all you guys over the next few days and seeing how it can apply to your respective fields thank you .i 've always been interested in the relationship of formal structures and human behavior if you build a wide road out to the outskirts of town people will move there well law is also a powerful driver of human behavior and what i 'd like to discuss today is the need to overhaul and simplify the law to release the energy and passion of americans so that we can begin to address the challenges of our society you might have noticed that law has grown progressively denser in your lives over the last decade or two if you run a business it 's hard to do much of anything without calling your general counsel indeed there is this phenomenon now where the general counsels are becoming the ceos it 's a little bit like the invasion of the body snatchers you need a lawyer to run the company because there 's so much law but it 's not just business that 's affected by this it 's actually pressed down into the daily activities of ordinary people a couple of years ago i was hiking near cody wyoming it was in a grizzly bear preserve although no one told me that before we went and our guide was a local science teacher she was wholly unconcerned about the bears but she was terrified of lawyers the stories started pouring out she 'd just been involved in an episode where a parent had threatened to sue the school because she lowered the grade of the student by 10 percent when he turned the paper in late the principal did n't want to stand up to the parent because he did n't want to get dragged into some legal proceedings so she had to go to meeting after meeting same arguments made over and over again after 30 days of sleepless nights she finally capitulated and raised the grade she said " life 's too short i just ca n't keep going with this " about the same time she was going to take two students to a leadership conference in laramie which is a couple of hours away and she was going to drive them in her car but the school said " no you ca n't drive them in the car for liability reasons you have to go in a school bus " so they provided a bus that held 60 people and drove the three of them back and forth several hours to laramie her husband is also a science teacher and he takes his biology class on a hike in the nearby national park but he was told he could n't go on the hike this year because one of the students in the class was disabled so the other 25 students did n't get to go on the hike either at the end of this day i could have filled a book just with stories about law from this one teacher now we 've been taught to believe that law is the foundation of freedom but somehow or another in the last couple of decades the land of the free has become a legal minefield it 's really changed our lives in ways that are sort of imperceptible and yet when you pull back you see it all the time it 's changed the way we talk i was talking to a pediatrician friend in north carolina he said " well you know i do n't deal with patients the same way anymore you would n't want to say something off-the-cuff that might be used against you " this is a doctor whose life is caring for people my own law firm has a list of questions that i 'm not allowed to ask when interviewing candidates such as the sinister question bulging with hidden motives and innuendo " where are you from " now for 20 years tort reformers have been sounding the alarm that lawsuits are out of control and we read every once in while about these crazy lawsuits like the guy in the district of columbia who sued his dry cleaners for 54 million dollars because they lost his pair of pants the case went on for two years i think he 's still appealing the case but the reality is these crazy cases are relatively rare they do n't usually win and the total of direct tort cost in this country is about two percent which is twice as much as in other countries but as taxes go hardly crippling but the direct costs are really only the tip of the iceberg what 's happened here again almost without our knowing is our culture has changed people no longer feel free to act on their best judgment so what do we do about it we certainly do n't want to give up the rights when people do something wrong to seek redress in the courts we need regulation to make sure people do n't pollute and such we lack even a vocabulary to deal with this problem and that 's because we have the wrong frame of reference we 've been trained to think that the way to look at every dispute every issue is a matter of kind of individual rights and so we peer through a legal microscope and look at everything is it possible that there are extenuating circumstances that explain why johnny turned his paper in late in cody wyoming is it possible that the doctor might have done something differently when the sick person gets sicker and of course the hindsight bias is perfect there 's always a different scenario that you can sketch out where it 's possible that something could have been done differently and yet we 've been trained to squint into this legal microscope hoping that we can judge any dispute against the standard of a perfect society where everyone will agree what 's fair and where accidents will be extinct risk will be no more of course this is utopia it 's a formula for paralysis not freedom it 's not the basis of the rule of law it 's not the basis of a free society so now i have the first of four propositions i 'm going to leave with you about how you simplify the law you 've got to judge law mainly by its effect on the broader society not individual disputes absolutely vital so let 's pull back from the anecdotes for a second and look at our society from high above is it working what does the macro-data show us well the healthcare system has been transformed a culture pervaded with defensiveness universal distrust of the system of justice universal practice of defensive medicine it 's very hard to measure because there are mixed motives doctors can make more on ordering tests sometimes and also they no longer even know what 's right or wrong but reliable estimates range between 60 billion and 200 billion dollars per year that 's enough to provide care to all the people in america who do n't have it the trial lawyers say " well this legal fear makes doctors practice better medicine " well that 's been studied too by the institute of medicine and others turns out that 's not the case the fear has chilled professional interaction so thousands of tragic errors occur because doctors are afraid to speak up " are you sure that 's the right dosage " because they 're not sure and they do n't want to take legal responsibility let 's go to schools as we saw with the teacher in cody wyoming she seems to be affected by the law well it turns out the schools are literally drowning in law you could have a separate section of a law library around each of the following legal concepts due process special education no child left behind zero tolerance work rules 1 it goes on we did a study of all the rules that affect one school in new york the board of ed had no idea tens of thousands of discreet rules 60 steps to suspend a student from school it 's a formula for paralysis what 's the effect of that one is a decline in order again studies have shown it 's directly attributable to the rise of due process public agenda did a survey for us a couple of years ago where they found that 43 percent of the high school teachers in america say that they spend at least half of their time maintaining order in the classroom that means those students are getting half the learning they 're supposed to because if one child is disrupting the class no one can learn and what happens when the teacher tries to assert order they 're threatened with a legal claim we also surveyed that seventy-eight percent of the middle and high school teachers in america have been threatened by their students with violating their rights with lawsuits by their students they are threatening their students it 's not that they usually sue it 's not that they would win but it 's an indication of the corrosion of authority and how has this system of law worked for government it does n't seem to be working very well does it neither in sacramento nor in washington the other day at the state of the union speech president obama said and i think we could all agree with this goal " from the first railroads to the interstate highway system our nation has always been the first to compete there is no reason europe or china should have the fastest trains " well actually there is a reason environmental review has evolved into a process of no pebble left unturned for any major project taking the better part of a decade then followed by years of litigation by anybody who does n't like the project then just staying above the earth for one more second people are acting like idiots all across the country idiots a couple of years ago broward county florida banned running at recess that means all the boys are going to be add i mean it 's just absolutely a formula for failure my favorite though are all the warning labels " caution contents are hot " on billions of coffee cups archeologists will dig us up in a thousand years and they wo n't know about defensive medicine and stuff but they 'll see all these labels " contents are extremely hot " they 'll think it was some kind of aphrodisiac that 's the only explanation because why would you have to tell people that something was actually hot my favorite warning was one on a five-inch fishing lure i grew up in the south and whiled away the summers fishing five-inch fishing lure it 's a big fishing lure with a three pronged hook in the back and outside it said " harmful if swallowed " so none of these people are doing what they think is right and why not they do n't trust the law why do n't they trust the law because it gives us the worst of both worlds it 's random [UNK] anybody can sue for almost anything and take it to a jury not even an effort at consistency [UNK] and it 's also too detailed in the areas that are regulated there are so many rules no human could possibly know it well how do you fix it we could spend 10,000 lifetimes trying to prune this legal jungle but the challenge here is not one of just amending the law because the hurdle for success is trust people [UNK] for law to be the platform for freedom people have to trust it so that 's my second proposition trust is an essential condition to a free society life is complicated enough without legal fear but law is different than other kinds of uncertainties because it carries with it the power of state and so the state can come in it actually changes the way people think it 's like having a little lawyer on your shoulders all day long whispering in your ear " could that go wrong might that go wrong " it drives people from the smart part of the brain [UNK] that dark deep well of the subconscious where instincts and experience and all the other factors of creativity and good judgment are [UNK] it drives us to the thin veneer of conscious logic pretty soon the doctor 's saying " well i doubt if that headache could be a tumor but who would protect me if it were so maybe i 'll just order the mri " then you 've wasted 200 billion dollars in unnecessary tests if you make people self-conscious about their judgments studies show you will make them make worse judgments if you tell the pianist to think about how she 's hitting the notes when she 's playing the piece she ca n't play the piece self-consciousness is the enemy of accomplishment edison stated it best he said " hell we ai n't got no rules around here we 're trying to accomplish something " so how do you restore trust tweaking the law 's clearly not good enough and tort reform which is a great idea lowers your cost if you 're a businessperson but it 's like a band-aid on this gaping wound of distrust states with extensive tort reform still suffer all these pathologies so what 's needed is not just to limit claims but actually create a dry ground of freedom it turns out that freedom actually has a formal structure and it is this law sets boundaries and on one side of those boundaries are all the things you ca n't do or must do [UNK] you ca n't steal you 've got to pay your taxes [UNK] but those same boundaries are supposed to define and protect a dry ground of freedom isaiah berlin put it this way " law sets frontiers not artificially drawn within which men shall be inviolable " we 've forgotten that second part those dikes have burst people wade through law all day long so what 's needed now is to rebuild these boundaries and it 's especially important to rebuild them for lawsuits because what people can sue for establishes the boundaries for everybody else 's freedom if someone brings a lawsuit over " a kid fell off the seesaw " it does n't matter what happens in the lawsuit all the seesaws will disappear because no one will want to take the risk of a lawsuit and that 's what 's happened there are no seesaws jungle gyms merry-go-rounds climbing ropes nothing that would interest a kid over the age of four because there 's no risk associated with it so how do we rebuild it life is too complex for 1 life is too complex for a software program all these choices involve value judgments and social norms not objective facts and so here is the fourth proposition this is what we have the philosophy we have to change to and there are two essential elements of it we have to simplify the law we have to migrate from all this complexity towards general principles and goals the constitution is only 16 pages long worked pretty well for 200 years law has to be simple enough so that people can internalize it in their daily choices if they ca n't internalize it they wo n't trust it and how do you make it simple because life is complex and here is the hardest and biggest change we have to restore the authority to judges and officials to interpret and apply the law we have to rehumanize the law to make law simple so that you feel free the people in charge have to be free to use their judgment to interpret and apply the law in accord with reasonable social norms as you 're going down and walking down the sidewalk during the day you have to think that if there is a dispute there 's somebody in society who sees it as their job to affirmatively protect you if you 're acting reasonably that person does n't exist today this is the hardest hurdle it 's actually not very hard ninety-eight percent of cases this is a piece of cake maybe you 've got a claim in small claims court for your lost pair of pants for $ 100 but not in a court of general jurisdiction for millions of dollars case dismissed without prejudice or refiling in small claims court takes five minutes that 's it it 's not that hard but it 's a hard hurdle because we got into this legal quicksand because we woke up in the 1960s to all these really bad values racism gender discrimination pollution [UNK] they were bad values and we wanted to create a legal system where no one could have bad values anymore the problem is we created a system where we eliminated the right to have good values it does n't mean that people in authority can do whatever they want they 're still bounded by legal goals and principles the teacher is accountable to the principal the judge is accountable to an appellate court the president is accountable to voters but the accountability 's up the line judging the decision against the effect on everybody not just on the disgruntled person you ca n't run a society by the lowest common denominator so what 's needed is a basic shift in philosophy we can pull the plug on a lot of this stuff if we shift our philosophy we 've been taught that authority is the enemy of freedom it 's not true authority in fact is essential to freedom law is a human institution responsibility is a human institution if teachers do n't have authority to run the classroom to maintain order everybody 's learning suffers if the judge does n't have the authority to toss out unreasonable claims then all of us go through the day looking over our shoulders if the environmental agency ca n't decide that the power lines are good for the environment then there 's no way to bring the power from the wind farms to the city a free society requires red lights and green lights otherwise it soon descends into gridlock that 's what 's happened to america look around what the world needs now is to restore the authority to make common choices it 's the only way to get our freedom back and it 's the only way to release the energy and passion needed so that we can meet the challenges of our time thank you .sadly in the next 18 minutes when i do our chat four americans that are alive will be dead from the food that they eat my name 's jamie oliver i 'm 34 years old i 'm from essex in england and for the last seven years i 've worked fairly tirelessly to save lives in my own way i 'm not a doctor i 'm a chef i do n't have expensive equipment or medicine i use information education i profoundly believe that the power of food has a primal place in our homes that binds us to the best bits of life we have an awful awful reality right now america you 're at the top of your game this is one of the most unhealthy countries in the world can i please just see a raise of hands for how many of you have children in this room today please put your hands up aunties uncles you can continue to put your hands up aunties and uncles as well most of you ok we the adults of the last four generations have blessed our children with the destiny of a shorter lifespan than their own parents your child will live a life ten years younger than you because of the landscape of food that we 've built around them two-thirds of this room today in america are statistically overweight or obese you lot you 're all right but we 'll get you eventually do n't worry right the statistics of bad health are clear very clear we spend our lives being paranoid about death murder homicide you name it it 's on the front page of every paper cnn look at homicide at the bottom for god 's sake right every single one of those in the red is a diet-related disease any doctor any specialist will tell you that fact diet-related disease is the biggest killer in the united states right now here today this is a global problem it 's a catastrophe it 's sweeping the world england is right behind you as usual i know they were close but not that close we need a revolution mexico australia germany india china all have massive problems of obesity and bad health think about smoking it costs way less than obesity now obesity costs you americans 10 percent of your healthcare bills 150 billion dollars a year in 10 years it 's set to double 300 billion dollars a year and let 's be honest guys you ai n't got that cash i came here to start a food revolution that i so profoundly believe in we need it the time is now we 're in a tipping-point moment i 've been doing this for seven years i 've been trying in america for seven years now is the time when it 's ripe [UNK] ripe for the picking i went to the eye of the storm i went to west virginia the most unhealthy state in america or it was last year we 've got a new one this year but we 'll work on that next season huntington west virginia beautiful town i wanted to put heart and soul and people your public around the statistics that we 've become so used to i want to introduce you to some of the people that i care about your public your children i want to show a picture of my friend brittany she 's 16 years old she 's got six years to live because of the food that she 's eaten she 's the third generation of americans that has n't grown up within a food environment where they 've been taught to cook at home or in school or her mom or her mom 's mom she has six years to live she 's eating her liver to death stacy the edwards family this is a normal family guys stacy does her best but she 's third-generation as well she was never taught to cook at home or in school the family 's obese justin here 12 years old he 's 350 pounds he gets bullied for god 's sake the daughter there katie she 's four years old she 's obese before she even gets to primary school marissa she 's all right she 's one of your lot but you know what her father who was obese died in her arms and then the second most important man in her life her uncle died of obesity and now her step-dad is obese you see the thing is obesity and diet-related disease does n't just hurt the people that have it it 's all of their friends families brothers sisters pastor steve an inspirational man one of my early allies in huntington west virginia he 's at the sharp knife-edge of this problem he has to bury the people ok and he 's fed up with it he 's fed up with burying his friends his family his community come winter three times as many people die he 's sick of it this is preventable disease waste of life by the way this is what they get buried in we 're not geared up to do this ca n't even get them out the door [UNK] and i 'm being serious [UNK] ca n't even get them there forklift ok i see it as a triangle ok this is our landscape of food i need you to understand it you 've probably heard all this before but let 's just go back over it over the last 30 years what 's happened that 's ripped the heart out of this country let 's be frank and honest well modern-day life let 's start with the main street fast food has taken over the whole country we know that the big brands are some of the most important powers powerful powers in this country supermarkets as well big companies big companies thirty years ago most of the food was largely local and largely fresh now it 's largely processed and full of all sorts of additives extra ingredients and you know the rest of the story portion size is obviously a massive massive problem labeling is a massive problem the labeling in this country is a disgrace they want to be self [UNK] they want to self-police themselves the industry wants to self-police themselves what in this kind of climate they do n't deserve it how can you say something is low-fat when it 's full of so much sugar home the biggest problem with the home is that used to be the heart of passing on food food culture what made our society that ai n't happening anymore and you know as we go to work and as life changes and as life always evolves we kind of have to look at it holistically [UNK] step back for a moment and re-address the balance it ai n't happening has n't happened for 30 years ok i want to show you a situation that is very normal right now the edwards family jamie oliver let 's have a talk this stuff goes through you and your family 's body every week and i need you to know that this is going to kill your children early how are you feeling stacy just feeling really sad and depressed right now but you know i want my kids to succeed in life and this is n't going to get them there but i 'm killing them jo yes you are you are but we can stop that normal let 's get on schools something that i 'm fairly much a specialist in ok school what is school who invented it what 's the purpose of school school was always invented to arm us with the tools to make us creative do wonderful things make us earn a living etc. etc. etc you know it 's been kind of in this sort of tight box for a long long time ok but we have n't really evolved it to deal with the health catastrophes of america ok school food is something that most kids [UNK] 31 million a day actually [UNK] have twice a day more than often breakfast and lunch 180 days of the year so you could say that school food is quite important really judging the circumstances before i crack into my rant which i 'm sure you 're waiting for 1 i need to say one thing and it 's so important in hopefully the magic that happens and unfolds in the next three months the lunch ladies the lunch cooks of america [UNK] i offer myself as their ambassador i 'm not slacking them off they 're doing the best they can do they 're doing their best but they 're doing what they 're told and what they 're being told to do is wrong the system is highly run by accountants there 's not enough or any food-knowledgeable people in the business there 's a problem if you 're not a food expert and you 've got tight budgets and it 's getting tighter then you ca n't be creative you ca n't duck and dive and write different things around things if you 're an accountant and a box-ticker the only thing you can do in these circumstances is buy cheaper shit now the reality is the food that your kids get every day is fast food it 's highly processed there 's not enough fresh food in there at all you know the amount of additives e numbers ingredients you would n't believe [UNK] there 's not enough veggies at all french fries are considered a vegetable pizza for breakfast they do n't even get given crockery knives and forks no they 're too dangerous they have scissors in the classroom but knives and forks no and the way i look at it is if you do n't have knives and forks in your school you 're purely endorsing from a state level fast food because it 's handheld and yes by the way it is fast food it 's sloppy joes it 's burgers it 's wieners it 's pizzas it 's all of that stuff ten percent of what we spend on healthcare as i said earlier is on obesity and it 's going to double we 're not teaching our kids there 's no statutory right to teach kids about food elementary or secondary school ok we do n't teach kids about food right and this is a little clip from an elementary school which is very common in england video who knows what this is child potatoes jamie oliver potato so you think these are potatoes do you know what that is do you know what that is child broccoli jo what about this our good old friend do you know what this is honey child celery jo no what do you think this is child onion jo onion no jamie oliver immediately you get a really clear sense of do the kids know anything about where food comes from video jo who knows what that is child uh pear jo what do you think this is child i do n't know jo if the kids do n't know what stuff is then they will never eat it jo normal england and america england and america guess what fixed that guess what fixed that two one-hour sessions we 've got to start teaching our kids about food in schools period i want to tell you about something i want to tell you about something that kind of epitomizes the trouble that we 're in guys ok i want to talk about something so basic as milk every kid has the right to milk at school your kids will be having milk at school breakfast and lunch right they 'll be having two bottles ok and most kids do but milk ai n't good enough anymore because someone at the milk board right [UNK] and do n't get me wrong i support milk [UNK] but someone at the milk board probably paid a lot of money for some geezer to work out that if you put loads of flavorings and colorings and sugar in milk right more kids will drink it yeah and obviously now that 's going to catch on the apple board is going to work out that if they make toffee apples they 'll eat more apples as well do you know what i mean for me there ai n't no need to flavor the milk okay there 's sugar in everything i know the ins and outs of those ingredients it 's in everything even the milk has n't escaped the kind of modern-day problems there 's our milk there 's our carton in that is nearly as much sugar as one of your favorite cans of fizzy pop and they are having two a day so let me just show you we 've got one kid here having you know eight tablespoons of sugar a day you know there 's your week there 's your month and i 've taken the liberty of putting in just the five years of elementary school sugar just from milk now i do n't know about you guys but judging the circumstances right any judge in the whole world would look at the statistics and the evidence and they would find any government of old guilty of child abuse that 's my belief now if i came up here and i wish i could come up here today and hang a cure for aids or cancer you 'd be fighting and scrambling to get to me this all this bad news is preventable that 's the good news it 's very very preventable so let 's just think about we got a problem here we need to reboot okay so in my world what do we need to do here is the thing right it can not just come from one source to reboot and make real tangible change real change so that i could look you in the white of the eyes and say " in 10 years time the history of your children 's lives happiness [UNK] and let 's not forget you 're clever if you eat well you know you 're going to live longer [UNK] all of that stuff it will look different ok " so supermarkets where else do you shop so religiously week in week out how much money do you spend in your life in a supermarket love them they just sell us what we want all right they owe us to put a food ambassador in every major supermarket they need to help us shop they need to show us how to cook quick tasty seasonal meals for people that are busy this is not expensive it is done in some and it needs to be done across the board in america soon and quick the big brands you know the food brands need to put food education at the heart of their businesses i know easier said than done it 's the future it 's the only way fast food with the fast-food industry you know it 's very competitive i 've had loads of secret papers and dealings with fast food restaurants i know how they do it i mean basically they 've weaned us on to these hits of sugar salt and fat and x y and z and everyone loves them right so these guys are going to be part of the solution but we need to get the government to work with all of the fast food purveyors and the restaurant industry and over a five six seven year period wean of us off the extreme amounts of fat sugar fat and all the other non-food ingredients now also back to the sort of big brands labeling i said earlier is an absolute farce and has got to be sorted ok school obviously in schools we owe it to them to make sure those 180 days of the year from that little precious age of four til 18 20 24 whatever they need to be cooked proper fresh food from local growers on site ok there needs to be a new standard of fresh proper food for your children yeah under the circumstances it 's profoundly important that every single american child leaves school knowing how to cook 10 recipes that will save their life life skills that means that they can be students young parents and be able to sort of duck and dive around the basics of cooking no matter what recession hits them next time if you can cook recession money does n't matter if you can cook time does n't matter the workplace we have n't really talked about it you know it 's now time for corporate responsibility to really look at what they feed or make available to their staff the staff are the moms and dads of america 's children marissa her father died in her hand i think she 'd be quite happy if corporate america could start feeding their staff properly definitely they should n't be left out let 's go back to the home now look if we do all this stuff and we can it 's so achievable you can care and be commercial absolutely but the home needs to start passing on cooking again for sure for sure pass it on as a philosophy and for me it 's quite romantic but it 's about if one person teaches three people how to cook something and they teach three of their mates that only has to repeat itself 25 times and that 's the whole population of america romantic yes but most importantly it 's about trying to get people to realize that every one of your individual efforts makes a difference we 've got to put back what 's been lost huntington kitchen huntington where i made this program you know we 've got this prime-time program that hopefully will inspire people to really get on this change i truly believe that change will happen huntington 's kitchen i work with a community i worked in the schools i found local sustainable funding to get every single school in the area from the junk onto the fresh food six-and-a-half grand per school that 's all it takes six-and-a-half grand per school the kitchen is 25 grand a month okay this can do 5,000 people a year which is 10 percent of their population and it 's people on people you know it 's local cooks teaching local people it 's free cooking lessons guys free cooking lessons in the main street this is real tangible change real tangible change around america if we just look back now there is plenty of wonderful things going on there is plenty of beautiful things going on there are angels around america doing great things in schools [UNK] farm-to-school set-ups garden set-ups education [UNK] there are amazing people doing this already the problem is they all want to roll out what they 're doing to the next school and the next but there 's no cash we need to recognize the experts and the angels quickly identify them and allow them to easily find the resource to keep rolling out what they 're already doing and doing well businesses of america need to support mrs. obama to do the things that she wants to do and look i know it 's weird having an english person standing here before you talking about all this all i can say is i care i 'm a father and i love this country and i believe truly actually that if change can be made in this country beautiful things will happen around the world if america does it i believe other people will follow it 's incredibly important when i was in huntington trying to get a few things to work when they were n't i thought " if i had a magic wand what would i do " and i thought " you know what i 'd just love to be put in front of some of the most amazing movers and shakers in america " and a month later ted phoned me up and gave me this award i 'm here so my wish dyslexic so i 'm a bit slow my wish is for you to help a strong sustainable movement to educate every child about food to inspire families to cook again and to empower people everywhere to fight obesity thank you .good morning i 've come here to share with you an experiment of how to get rid of one form of human suffering it really is a story of dr. venkataswamy his mission and his message is about the aravind eye care system i think first it 's important for us to recognize what it is to be blind woman everywhere i went looking for work they said no what use do we have for a blind woman i could n't thread a needle or see the lice in my hair if an ant fell into my rice i could n't see that either thulasiraj ravilla becoming blind is a big part of it but i think it also deprives the person of their livelihood their dignity their independence and their status in the family so she is just one amongst the millions who are blind and the irony is that they do n't need to be a simple well-proven surgery can restore sight to millions and something even simpler a pair of glasses can make millions more see if we add to that the many of us here now who are more productive because they have a pair of glasses then almost one in five indians will require eye care a staggering 200 million people today we 're reaching not even 10 percent of them so this is the context in which aravind came into existence about 30 years back as a post-retirement project of dr. v he started this with no money he had to mortgage all his life savings to make a bank loan and over time we have grown into a network of five hospitals predominately in the state of tamil nadu and puducherry and then we added several what we call vision centers as a hub-and-spoke model and then more recently we started managing hospitals in other parts of the country and also setting up hospitals in other parts of the world as well the last three decades we have done about three-and-a-half million surgeries a vast majority of them for the poor people now each year we perform about 300,000 surgeries a typical day at aravind we would do about a thousand surgeries maybe see about 6,000 patients send out teams into the villages to examine bring back patients lots of telemedicine consultations and on top of that do a lot of training both for doctors and technicians who will become the future staff of aravind and then doing this day-in and day-out and doing it well requires a lot of inspiration and a lot of hard work and i think this was possible thanks to the building blocks put in place by dr. v. a value system an efficient delivery process and fostering the culture of innovation dr. v i used to sit with the ordinary village man because i am from a village and suddenly you turn around and seem to be in contact with his inner being you seem to be one with him here is a soul which has got all the simplicity of confidence doctor whatever you say i accept it an implicit faith in you and then you respond to it here is an old lady who has got so much faith in me i must do my best for her when we grow in spiritual consciousness we identify ourselves with all that is in the world so there is no exploitation it is ourselves we are helping it is ourselves we are healing this helped us build a very ethical and very highly patient-centric organization and systems that support it but on a practical level you also have to deliver services efficiently and odd as it may seem the inspiration came from mcdonald 's dr. v see mcdonald 's ' concept is simple they feel they can train people all over the world irrespective of different religions cultures all those things to produce a product in the same way and deliver it in the same manner in hundreds of places larry brilliant he kept talking about mcdonalds and hamburgers and none of it made any sense to us he wanted to create a franchise a mechanism of delivery of eye care with the efficiency of mcdonald 's dr. v supposing i 'm able to produce eye care techniques methods all in the same way and make it available in every corner of the world the problem of blindness is gone tr if you think about it i think the eyeball is the same as american or african the problem is the same the treatment is the same and yet why should there be so much variation in quality and in service and that was the fundamental principle that we followed when we designed the delivery systems and of course the challenge was that it 's a huge problem we are talking of millions of people very little resource to deal with it and then lots of logistics and affordability issues and then so one had to constantly innovate and one of the early innovations which still continues is to create ownership in the community to the problem and then engage with them as a partner and here is one such event here a community camp just organized by the community themselves where they find a place organize volunteers and then we 'll do our part you know check their vision and then you have doctors who you find out what the problem is and then determine what further testing should be done and then those tests are done by technicians who check for glasses or check for glaucoma and then with all these results the doctor makes a final diagnosis and then prescribes a line of treatment and if they need a pair of glasses they are available right there at the camp site usually under a tree but they get glasses in the frames of their choice and that 's very important because i think glasses in addition to helping people see is also a fashion statement and they 're willing to pay for it so they get it in about 20 minutes and those who require surgery are counseled and then there are buses waiting which will transport them to the base hospital and if it was not for this kind of logistics and support many people like this would probably never get services and certainly not when they most need it they receive surgery the following day and then they will stay for a day or two and then they are put back on the buses to be taken back to where they came from and where their families will be waiting to take them back home and this happens several thousand times each year it may sound impressive that we 're seeing lots of patients very efficient process but we looked at are we solving the problem we did a study a scientifically designed process and then to our dismay we found this was only reaching seven percent of those in need and we 're not adequately addressing more bigger problems so we had to do something different so we set up what we call primary eye care centers vision centers these are truly paperless offices with completely electronic medical records and so on they receive comprehensive eye exams we kind of changed the simple digital camera into a retinal camera and then every patient gets their teleconsultation with a doctor the effect of this has been that within the first year we really had a 40 percent penetration in the market that it served which is over 50,000 people and the second year went up to 75 percent so i think we have a process by which we can really penetrate into the market and reach everyone who needs it and in this process of using technology make sure that most do n't need to come to the base hospital and how much will they pay for this we fixed the pricing taking into account what they would save in bus fare in coming to a city so they pay about 20 rupees and that 's good for three consultations the other challenge was how do you give high-tech or more advanced treatment and care we designed a van with a vsat which sends out images of patients to the base hospital where it is diagnosed and then as the patient is waiting the report goes back to the patient it gets printed out the patient gets it and then gets a consultation about what they should be doing [UNK] i mean go see a doctor or come back after six months and then this happens as a way of bridging the technology competence so the impact of all this has been essentially one of growing the market because it focused on the non-customer and then by reaching the unreached we 're able to significantly grow the market the other aspect is how do you deal with this efficiently when you have very few ophthalmologists so what is in this video is a surgeon operating and then you see on the other side another patient is getting ready so as they finish the surgery they just swing the microscope over the tables are placed so that their distance is just right and then we need to do this because by doing this kind of process we 're able to more than quadruple the productivity of the surgeon and then to support the surgeon we require a certain workforce and then we focused on village girls that we recruited and then they really are the backbone of the organization they do almost all of the skill-based routine tasks they do one thing at a time they do it extremely well with the result we have very high productivity very high quality at very very low cost so putting all this together what really happened was the productivity of our staff was significantly higher than anyone else this is a very busy table but what this really is conveying is that when it comes to quality we have put in very good quality-assurance systems as a result our complications are significantly lower than what has been reported in the united kingdom and you do n't see those kind of numbers very often so the final part of the puzzle is how do you make all this work financially especially when the people ca n't pay for it so what we did was we gave away a lot of it for free and then those who pay i mean they paid local market rates nothing more and often much less and we were helped by the market inefficiency i think that has been a big savior even now and of course one needs the mindset to be wanting to give away what you have as a surplus the result has been over the years the expenditure has increased with volumes the revenues increase at a higher level giving us a healthy margin while you 're treating a large number of people for free i think in absolute terms last year we earned about 20-odd million dollars spent about 13 million with over a 40 percent ebita but this really requires going beyond what we do or what we have done if you really want to achieve solving this problem of blindness and what we did was a couple of very counter-intuitive things we created competition for ourselves and then we made eye care affordable by making low-cost consumables we proactively and systematically promoted these practices to many hospitals in india many in our own backyards and then in other parts of the world as well the impact of this has been that these hospitals in the second year after our consultation are double their output and then achieve financial recovery as well the other part was how do you address this increase in cost of technology there was a time when we failed to negotiate the [ intra-ocular lens ] prices to be at affordable levels so we set up a manufacturing unit and then over time we were able to bring down the cost significantly to about two percent of what it used to be when we started out today we believe we have about seven percent of the global market and they 're used in about 120-odd countries to conclude i mean what we do does it have a broader relevance or is it just india or developing countries so to address this we studied uk versus aravind what it shows is that we do roughly about 60 percent of the volume of what the uk does near a half-million surgeries as a whole country and we do about 300,000 and then we train about 50 ophthalmologists against the 70 trained by them comparable quality both in training and in patient care so we 're really comparing apples to apples we looked at cost so i think it is simple to say just because the u.k. is n't india the difference is happening i think there is more to it i mean i think one has to look at other aspects as well maybe there is [UNK] the solution to the cost could be in productivity maybe in efficiency in the clinical process or in how much they pay for the lenses or consumables or regulations their defensive practice so i think decoding this can probably bring answers to most developed countries including the u.s. and maybe obama 's ratings can go up again another insight which again i want to leave with you in conditions where the problem is very large which cuts across all economic strata where we have a good solution i think the process i described you know productivity quality patient-centered care can give an answer and there are many which fit this paradigm you take dentistry hearing aid maternity and so on there are many where this paradigm can now play but i think probably one of the most challenging things is on the softer side now how do you create compassion now how do you make people own the problem want to do something about it there are a bit harder issues and i 'm sure people in this crowd can probably find the solutions to these so i want to end my talk leaving this thought and challenge to you dr. v when you grow in spiritual consciousness we identify with all that is in the world so there is no exploitation it is ourselves we are helping it is ourselves we are healing tr thank you very much .this is a river this is a stream this is a river this is happening all over the country there are tens of thousands of miles of dewatered streams in the united states on this map the colored areas represent water conflicts similar problems are emerging in the east as well the reasons vary state to state but mostly in the details there are 4,000 miles of dewatered streams in montana alone they would ordinarily support fish and other wildlife they 're the veins of the ecosystem and they 're often empty veins i want to tell you the story of just one of these streams because it 's an archetype for the larger story this is prickly pear creek it runs through a populated area from east helena to lake helena it supports wild fish including cutthroat brown and rainbow trout nearly every year for more than a hundred years it 's looked like this in the summer how did we get here well it started back in the late 1800s when people started settling in places like montana in short there was a lot of water and there were n't very many people but as more people showed up wanting water the folks who were there first got a little concerned and in 1865 montana passed its first water law it basically said everybody near the stream can share in the stream oddly a lot of people showed up wanting to share the stream and the folks who were there first got concerned enough to bring out their lawyers there were precedent-setting suits in 1870 and 1872 both involving prickly pear creek and in 1921 the montana supreme court ruled in a case involving prickly pear that the folks who were there first had the first or " senior water rights " these senior water rights are key the problem is that all over the west now it looks like this some of these creeks have claims for 50 to 100 times more water than is actually in the stream and the senior water rights holders if they do n't use their water right they risk losing their water right along with the economic value that goes with it so they have no incentive to conserve so it 's not just about the number of people the system itself creates a disincentive to conserve because you can lose your water right if you do n't use it so after decades of lawsuits and 140 years now of experience we still have this it 's a broken system there 's a disincentive to conserve because if you do n't use your water right you can lose your water right and i 'm sure you all know this has created significant conflicts between the agricultural and environmental communities okay now i 'm going to change gears here most of you will be happy to know that the rest of the presentation 's free and some of you 'll be happy to know that it involves beer there 's another thing happening around the country which is that companies are starting to get concerned about their water footprint they 're concerned about securing an adequate supply of water they 're trying to be really efficient with their water use and they 're concerned about how their water use affects the image of their brand well it 's a national problem but i 'm going to tell you another story from montana and it involves beer i bet you did n't know it takes about 5 pints of water to make a pint of beer if you include all the drain it takes more than a hundred pints of water to make a pint of beer now the brewers in montana have already done a lot to reduce their water consumption but they still use millions of gallons of water i mean there 's water in beer so what can they do about this remaining water footprint that can have serious effects on the ecosystem these ecosystems are really important to the montana brewers and their customers after all there 's a strong correlation between water and fishing and for some there 's a strong correlation between fishing and beer so the montana brewers and their customers are concerned and they 're looking for some way to address the problem so how can they address this remaining water footprint remember prickly pear up until now business water stewardship has been limited to measuring and reducing and we 're suggesting that the next step is to restore remember prickly pear it 's a broken system you 've got a disincentive to conserve because if you do n't use your water right you risk losing your water right well we decided to connect these two worlds [UNK] the world of the companies with their water footprints and the world of the farmers with their senior water rights on these creeks in some states senior water rights holders can leave their water in-stream while legally protecting it from others and maintaining their water right after all it is their water right and if they want to use that water right to help the fish grow in the stream it 's their right to do so but they have no incentive to do so so working with local water trusts we created an incentive to do so we pay them to leave their water in-stream that 's what 's happening here this individual has made the choice and is closing this water diversion leaving the water in the stream he does n't lose the water right he just chooses to apply that right or some portion of it to the stream instead of to the land because he 's the senior water rights holder he can protect the water from other users in the stream okay he gets paid to leave the water in the stream this guy 's measuring the water that this leaves in the stream we then take the measured water we divide it into thousand-gallon increments each increment gets a serial number and a certificate and then the brewers and others buy those certificates as a way to return water to these degraded ecosystems the brewers pay to restore water to the stream it provides a simple inexpensive and measurable way to return water to these degraded ecosystems while giving farmers an economic choice and giving businesses concerned about their water footprints an easy way to deal with them after 140 years of conflict and 100 years of dry streams a circumstance that litigation and regulation has not solved we put together a market-based willing buyer willing seller solution [UNK] a solution that does not require litigation it 's about giving folks concerned about their water footprints a real opportunity to put water where it 's critically needed into these degraded ecosystems while at the same time providing farmers a meaningful economic choice about how their water is used these transactions create allies not enemies they connect people rather than dividing them and they provide needed economic support for rural communities and most importantly it 's working we 've returned more than four billion gallons of water to degraded ecosystems we 've connected senior water rights holders with brewers in montana with hotels and tea companies in oregon and with high-tech companies that use a lot of water in the southwest and when we make these connections we can and we do turn this into this thank you very much transcript

business -- and its bold side projects.description keywordsbusiness,charter for compassion,culturekeywords talkid1113talkid titleChade-Meng Tan Everyday compassion at Googletitle transcript so what does the happiest man in the world look like he certainly does n't look like me he looks like this his name is matthieu ricard so how do you get to be the happiest man in the world well it turns out there is a way to measure happiness in the brain and you do that by measuring the relative activation of the left prefrontal cortex in the fmri versus the right prefrontal cortex and matthieu 's happiness measure is off the charts he 's by far the happiest man ever measured by science which leads us to a question what was he thinking when he was being measured perhaps something very naughty actually he was meditating on compassion matthieu 's own experience is that compassion is the happiest state ever reading about matthieu was one of the pivotal moments of my life my dream is to create the conditions for world peace in my lifetime [UNK] and to do that by creating the conditions for inner peace and compassion on a global scale and learning about matthieu gave me a new angle to look at my work matthieu 's brain scan shows that compassion is not a chore compassion is something that creates happiness compassion is fun and that mind-blowing insight changes the entire game because if compassion was a chore nobody 's going to do it except maybe the dalai lama or something but if compassion was fun everybody 's going to do it therefore to create the conditions for global compassion all we have to do is to reframe compassion as something that is fun but fun is not enough what if compassion is also profitable what if compassion is also good for business then every boss every manager in the world will want to have compassion [UNK] like this that would create the conditions for world peace so i started paying attention to what compassion looks like in a business setting fortunately i did n't have to look very far because what i was looking for was right in front of my eyes [UNK] in google my company i know there are other compassionate companies in the world but google is the place i 'm familiar with because i 've been there for 10 years so i 'll use google as the case study google is a company born of idealism it 's a company that thrives on idealism and maybe because of that compassion is organic and widespread company-wide in google expressions of corporate compassion almost always follow the same pattern it 's sort of a funny pattern it starts with a small group of googlers taking the initiative to do something and they do n't usually ask for permission they just go ahead and do it and then other googlers join in and it just gets bigger and bigger and sometimes it gets big enough to become official so in other words it almost always starts from the bottom up and let me give you some examples the first example is the largest annual community event [UNK] where googlers from around the world donate their labor to their local communities [UNK] was initiated and organized by three employees before it became official because it just became too big another example three googlers [UNK] a chef an engineer and most funny a massage therapist [UNK] three of them they learned about a region in india where 200,000 people live without a single medical facility so what do they do they just go ahead and start a fundraiser and they raise enough money to build this hospital [UNK] the first hospital of its kind for 200,000 people during the haiti earthquake a number of engineers and product managers spontaneously came together and stayed overnight to build a tool to allow earthquake victims to find their loved ones and expressions of compassion are also found in our international offices in china for example one mid-level employee initiated the largest social action competition in china involving more than 1,000 schools in china working on issues such as education poverty health care and the environment there is so much organic social action all around google that the company decided to form a social responsibility team just to support these efforts and this idea again came from the grassroots from two googlers who wrote their own job descriptions and volunteered themselves for the job and i found it fascinating that the social responsibility team was not formed as part of some grand corporate strategy it was two persons saying " let 's do this " and the company said " yes " so it turns out that google is a compassionate company because googlers found compassion to be fun but again fun is not enough there are also real business benefits so what are they the first benefit of compassion is that it creates highly effective business leaders what does that mean there are three components of compassion there is the affective component which is " i feel for you " there is the cognitive component which is " i understand you " and there is a motivational component which is " i want to help you " so what has this got to do with business leadership according to a very comprehensive study led by jim collins and documented in the book " good to great " it takes a very special kind of leader to bring a company from goodness to greatness and he calls them " level 5 leaders " these are leaders who in addition to being highly capable possess two important qualities and they are humility and ambition these are leaders who are highly ambitious for the greater good and because they 're ambitious for a greater good they feel no need to inflate their own egos and they according to the research make the best business leaders and if you look at these qualities in the context of compassion we find that the cognitive and affective components of compassion [UNK] understanding people and empathizing with people [UNK] inhibits tones down what i call the excessive self-obsession that 's in us therefore creating the conditions for humility the motivational component of compassion creates ambition for greater good in other words compassion is the way to grow level 5 leaders and this is the first compelling business benefit the second compelling benefit of compassion is that it creates an inspiring workforce employees mutually inspire each other towards greater good it creates a vibrant energetic community where people admire and respect each other i mean you come to work in the morning and you work with three guys who just up and decide to build a hospital in india it 's like how can you not be inspired by those people [UNK] your own coworkers so this mutual inspiration promotes collaboration initiative and creativity it makes us a highly effective company so having said all that what is the secret formula for brewing compassion in the corporate setting in our experience there are three ingredients the first ingredient is to create a culture of passionate concern for the greater good so always think how is your company and your job serving the greater good or how can you further serve the greater good this awareness of serving the greater good is very self-inspiring and it creates fertile ground for compassion to grow in that 's one the second ingredient is autonomy so in google there 's a lot of autonomy and one of our most popular managers jokes that this is what he says " google is a place where the inmates run the asylum " and he considers himself one of the inmates if you already have a culture of compassion and idealism and you let your people roam free they will do the right thing in the most compassionate way the third ingredient is to focus on inner development and personal growth leadership training in google for example places a lot of emphasis on the inner qualities such as self-awareness self-mastery empathy and compassion because we believe that leadership begins with character we even created a seven-week curriculum on emotion intelligence which we jokingly call " searching inside yourself " it 's less naughty than it sounds so i 'm an engineer by training but i 'm one of the creators and instructors of this course which i find kind of funny because this is a company that trusts an engineer to teach emotion intelligence what a company so " search inside yourself " [UNK] how does it work it works in three steps the first step is attention training attention is the basis of all higher cognitive and emotional abilities therefore any curriculum for training emotion intelligence has to begin with attention training the idea here is to train attention to create a quality of mind that is calm and clear at the same time and this creates the foundation for emotion intelligence the second step follows the first step the second step is developing self-knowledge and self-mastery so using the supercharged attention from step one we create a high-resolution perception into the cognitive and emotive processes what does that mean it means being able to observe our thought stream and the process of emotion with high clarity objectivity and from a third-person perspective and once you can do that you create the kind of self-knowledge that enables self-mastery the third step following the second step is to create new mental habits what does that mean imagine this imagine whenever you meet any other person any time you meet a person your habitual instinctive first thought is " i want you to be happy i want you to be happy " imagine you can do that having this habit this mental habit changes everything at work because this good will is unconsciously picked up by other people and it creates trust and trust creates a lot of good working relationships and this also creates the conditions for compassion in the workplace someday we hope to open-source " search inside yourself " so that everybody in the corporate world will at least be able to use it as a reference and in closing i want to end the same place i started with happiness i want to quote this guy [UNK] the guy in robes not the other guy [UNK] the dalai lama who said " if you want others to be happy practice compassion if you want to be happy practice compassion " i found this to be true both on the individual level and at a corporate level and i hope that compassion will be both fun and profitable for you too thank you .chris has been so nice i do n't know how you keep it up chris i really do n't so nice all week he 's the kind of man you could say to " chris i 'm really sorry i 've crashed your car and it gets worse i crashed it into your house your house has caught fire and what 's more your wife has just run off with your best friend " and you know that chris would say " thank you " " thank you for sharing that 's really interesting " " thank you for taking me to a place that i did n't know existed thank you " one of the [UNK] thank you for inviting us one of the things about appearing later on in the ted week is that gradually as the days go by all the other speakers cover most of what you were going to say nuclear fusion i had about 10 minutes on that spectroscopy that was another one parallel universes and so this morning i thought " oh well i 'll just do a card trick " that one 's gone as well and today is emmanuel 's day i think we 've agreed that already have n't we emmanuel absolutely i was planning on finishing on a dance 1 so that 's going to look pretty shabby now so what i thought i 'd do is [UNK] in honor of emmanuel [UNK] is what i can do is to launch today the first ted global auction if i could start this is the enigma decoding machine who will start me with $ 1,000 anyone thank you bruno 's face just then he said " no do n't go through this do n't please do n't do n't go through this do n't do it " i 'm worried when i first got the invitation they said somewhere in the thing they said " 15 minutes to change the world your moment onstage " 15 minutes to change the world i do n't know about you it takes me 15 minutes to change a plug so the idea of changing the world is really quite an extraordinary one well of course now we know we do n't have to change a plug now we 've seen that wonderful demonstration of the wireless electric [UNK] fantastic you know it inspires us 300 years ago he 'd have been burnt at the stake for that and now it 's an idea it 's great it 's fantastic but you do meet some fantastic people people who look at the world in a totally different way yesterday david deutsch another one who covered most of what i was going to say but when you think of the world in that way it does make going to starbucks a whole new experience do n't you think i mean he must walk in and they will say " would you like a macchiato or a latte or an americano or a cappuccino " and he 'll say " you 're offering me things that are infinitely variable " " how can your coffee be true " and they will say " would you mind if i serve the next customer " and elaine morgan yesterday was n't she wonderful fantastic really good her talk about the aquatic ape and the link of course the link between darwinism and the fact that we are all naked beneath this [UNK] we 're not hirsute and we can swim rather well and she said you know she 's 90 she 's running out of time she said and she 's desperate to find more evidence for the link and i think " i 'm sitting next to lewis pugh " this man has swum around the north pole what more evidence do you want and there he is that 's how ted brings these connections together i was n't here on tuesday i did n't actually see gordon brown 's job application [UNK] um sorry i 'm so sorry i 'm so sorry no no no no ahh 1 " global problems require scottish solutions " the problem i have is because gordon brown he comes onstage and he looks for all the world like a man who 's just taken the head off a bear suit " hello can i tell you what happened in the woods back there uh no " " i 'm sorry i 've only got 18 minutes 18 minutes to talk about saving the world saving the planet global institutions our work on climate change i 've only got 18 minutes unfortunately i 'm not able to tell you about all the wonderful things we 're doing to promote the climate change agenda in great britain like the third runway we 're planning at heathrow airport 1 " " the large coal-fired power station we 're building at king 's north and of course the exciting news that only today only this week britain 's only manufacturer of wind turbines has been forced to close no time unfortunately to mention those " " british jobs for scottish people 1 no " " christian principles christian values thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal thou shalt not covet thy neighbor 's wife " " although to be honest when i was at number 11 that was never going to be a problem " " yeah alright come on eh alright gordon come on eh i just can i just say a few things about first about cherie because she 's a wonderful lady my wife with a wonderful smile that reminds me i must post that letter " " i just think you know what people forget gordon and i we always got on perfectly well alright it was never exactly 'brokeback mountain ' " " you know i wrote to him just before i left office i said 'can i rely on your support for the next month ' and he wrote back he said 'no you ca n't ' which kind of surprised me because i 'd never seen 'ca n't ' spelled that way before " another thing gordon could have mentioned in his speech to the mansion house in 2002 [UNK] that was to the building the people were n't listening but the people when talking about the finance industry he said " what you as the city of london have done for financial services we as a government hope to do for the economy as a whole " when you think what 's happened to financial services and you see what 's happened to the economy you think " well there is a man who delivers on his promises " but we 're in a new world now we 're in a completely new world this is the first time that i can remember where if you get a letter from the bank manager about a loan you do n't know if you 're borrowing money from him or if he 's borrowing money from you am i right these extraordinary things icelandic internet accounts did anyone here have an icelandic internet account why would you do that why would [UNK] it 's like one step up from replying to one of those emails from nigeria is n't it asking for your bank details and you know iceland it was never going to cut it it did n't have that kind of collateral what does it have it has fish that 's all that 's why the prime minister went on television he said " this has left us all with a very big haddock " a lot of what i do [UNK] i have to try and make sense of things before i can make nonsense of them and making sense of the financial crisis is very very difficult luckily somebody like george bush was really helpful he summed it up really at a dinner he was speaking at a dinner he said " wall street got drunk " " and now it 's got a hangover " and that 's you know that 's something [UNK] and that 's something we can relate to it 's certainly something he can relate to and the other one of course is donald rumsfeld who said " there are the known knowns the things we know we know and then you got the known unknowns the things we know we do n't know and then you got the unknown unknowns those are the things we do n't know we do n't know " and being english when i first heard that i thought " what a load of cock " and then you 're now well actually that 's what this is about this whole what ben bernanke has said the chaotic unwinding of the world 's financial system it 's about [UNK] they do n't know they did n't know what they were doing in 2006 the head of the american mortgage bankers association said quote " as we can clearly see no seismic occurrence is about to overwhelm the u.s economy " now there is a man on top of his job and when the crisis was happening the head of quantitative equities at lehman brothers said " events which models predicted would happen once every 10,000 years happened every day for three days " so it 's extraordinary it 's a new world that 's very very difficult to make sense of but we have a new hope we have a new man america has now elected its first openly black president wonderful news not only that he 's left-handed have you noticed this how many people here are left-handed you see a lot of the people that i most admire they 're great artists great designers great thinkers they 're left-handed and somebody said to me last night you know being left-handed you have to learn to write without smudging the ink and somebody was talking about metaphors on monday and i thought what a wonderful metaphor is n't it an american president who has to write without smudging the ink you like that one as opposed to you could see george bush well what 's the metaphor there i think it would be something out of the aquatic ape thing would n't it " well you know i 'm sorry about that i 'm right-handed but i seem to have smudged that ink as well " but you know he 's gone now he 's gone that 's eight years of american history eight minutes of my act just gone like that " you know it 's the end of an error [ sic ] i happen to believe it was a great error i know folks said to me they believe it was one of the greatest errors in the history of the united states but we proved them wrong in iraq they said there was no link between iraq and al qaeda there is now " " but i have a message for the suicide bombers for those people who 've blown themselves up " " we 're going to find you " " we 're going to make sure you do n't do it again " but now he 's gone and it 's great to see one of the [UNK] arguably one of the worst speech makers in american history now given way to one of the greatest in obama you were there maybe on the night of his victory and he spoke to the crowd in chicago he said " if there is anyone out there who still doubts that america is a place where all things are possible 1 " i ca n't do the whole thing because it would take too long it really would but you get the picture and then it goes to the inauguration and he and the chief justice they trip over each other they get their words wrong and they screw the thing up and there is george bush sitting there going " heh heh heh heh 1 " " not so easy is it heh heh heh " but the interesting thing is gordon brown was talking about cicero who said people would listen to a speech they said " great speech " and then they 'd listen to demosthenes and they 'd say " let 's march " and we all want to believe in president obama it 's rather like that line in the film " as good as it gets " do you remember that film with helen hunt and jack nicholson and helen hunt says to jack nicholson " what do you see in me " and jack nicholson just says " you make me want to be a better man " and you want a leader who inspires and challenges and makes you want to be a better citizen right but at the moment it 's a cicero thing we like what barack obama says but we do n't do anything about it so he comes over to this country and he says " we need a big fiscal stimulus " and everyone goes " great 1 " he leaves the country and the french and the germans go " no no forget about that absolutely not " nothing happens he goes to strasburg he says " we need more boots on the ground in afghanistan " and everyone goes " great idea " he leaves people go " no no no we 're not going to do that 5,000 maximum and no rockets no no not going to do it " he goes to prague he says " we believe in a nuclear-free world " and it 's great to have an american president who can say the word " nuclear " let 's just point that out first do you remember that george bush " a nu-ca-ler " sorry what " a nu-ca-ler " could you say " avuncular " " avunclear " thank you very much but he says " we want a nuclear-free world " and that day north korea that very day north korea is just seeing if it can just get one over japan [UNK] [UNK] and land it before 1 so where do we look for inspiration we 've still got bill clinton " travels the world " " i believe i believe it was president dwight d. eisenhower who said 1 " " tell a lie it was diana ross 1 " " 1 who said reach out and touch 1 " " 1 somebody 's gla [UNK] hand " " make this world a better place if you can i just think that 's important i really do and i was hoping hillary would get to the white house because she 'd have been out of our home for four years and i you know " " so when that did n't work out i had to make a few arrangements let me tell you " so there 's him in britain we have prince charles " and the environment is so important all we can do my wife gets fed up with me constantly trying to push emissions up her agenda " or any south africans we have mandela to inspire mandela the great man mandela he 's been honored with a statue now the previous highest honor he had in britain was a visit from the team from ground force a gardening program " so nelson how would you like a nice water feature " " ahh listen to me mr titchmarsh " " i was held in prison for nearly 30 years on an island in the middle of the ocean why would i need a bloody water feature " very quickly i was n't quite sure how to end this talk and then yesterday that man came up with a wonderful quote from the " japanese essays on idleness " which said it 's nice to have something which is unfinished because it implies there is still room for growth thank you very much indeed .how many of you had to fill out some sort of web form where you 've been asked to read a distorted sequence of characters like this how many of you found it really really annoying okay outstanding so i invented that or i was one of the people who did it that thing is called a captcha and the reason it is there is to make sure you the entity filling out the form are actually a human and not some sort of computer program that was written to submit the form millions and millions of times the reason it works is because humans at least non-visually-impaired humans have no trouble reading these distorted squiggly characters whereas computer programs simply ca n't do it as well yet so for example in the case of ticketmaster the reason you have to type these distorted characters is to prevent scalpers from writing a program that can buy millions of tickets two at a time captchas are used all over the internet and since they 're used so often a lot of times the precise sequence of random characters that is shown to the user is not so fortunate so this is an example from the yahoo registration page the random characters that happened to be shown to the user were w a i t which of course spell a word but the best part is the message that the yahoo help desk got about 20 minutes later text " help 1 i 've been waiting for over 20 minutes and nothing happens " this person thought they needed to wait this of course is not as bad as this poor person captcha project is something that we did here at carnegie melllon over 10 years ago and it 's been used everywhere let me now tell you about a project that we did a few years later which is sort of the next evolution of captcha this is a project that we call recaptcha which is something that we started here at carnegie mellon then we turned it into a startup company and then about a year and a half ago google actually acquired this company so let me tell you what this project started so this project started from the following realization it turns out that approximately 200 million captchas are typed everyday by people around the world when i first heard this i was quite proud of myself i thought look at the impact that my research has had but then i started feeling bad see here 's the thing each time you type a captcha essentially you waste 10 seconds of your time and if you multiply that by 200 million you get that humanity as a whole is wasting about 500,000 hours every day typing these annoying captchas so then i started feeling bad and then i started thinking well of course we ca n't just get rid of captchas because the security of the web sort of depends on them but then i started thinking is there any way we can use this effort for something that is good for humanity while you 're typing a captcha during those 10 seconds your brain is doing something amazing your brain is doing something that computers can not yet do so can we get you to do useful work for those 10 seconds is there some humongous problem that we can not yet get computers to solve yet we can split into tiny 10-second chunks such that each time somebody solves a captcha they solve a little bit of this problem and the answer to that is " yes " and this is what we 're doing now so what you may not know is that nowadays while you 're typing a captcha not only are you authenticating yourself as a human but in addition you 're actually helping us to digitize books so let me explain how this works so there 's a lot of projects out there trying to digitize books google has one the internet archive has one amazon now with the kindle is trying to digitize books basically the way this works is you start with an old book you 've seen those things right like a book so you start with a book and then you scan it now scanning a book is like taking a digital photograph of every page of the book it gives you an image for every page of the book this is an image with text for every page of the book the next step in the process is that the computer needs to be able to decipher all of the words in this image that 's using a technology called ocr for optical character recognition which takes a picture of text and tries to figure out what text is in there now the problem is that ocr is not perfect especially for older books where the ink has faded and the pages have turned yellow ocr can not recognize a lot of the words for example for things that were written more than 50 years ago the computer can not recognize about 30 percent of the words is we 're taking all of the words that the computer can not recognize and we 're getting people to read them for us while they 're typing a captcha on the internet so the next time you type a captcha these words that you 're typing are actually words that are coming from books that are being digitized that the computer could not recognize and now the reason we have two words nowadays instead of one is because you see one of the words is a word that the system just got out of a book it did n't know what it was and it 's going to present it to you but since it does n't know the answer for it it can not grade it for you so what we do is we give you another word one for which the system does know the answer we do n't tell you which one 's which and we say please type both and if you type the correct word for the one for which the system already knows the answer it assumes you are human and it also gets some confidence that you typed the other word correctly and if we repeat this process to like 10 different people and all of them agree on what the new word is then we get one more word digitized accurately so this is how the system works and basically since we released it about three or four years ago a lot of websites have started switching from the old captcha where people wasted their time to the new captcha where people are helping to digitize books so for example ticketmaster so every time you buy tickets on ticketmaster you help to digitize a book facebook every time you add a friend or poke somebody you help to digitize a book twitter and about 350,000 other sites are all using recaptcha and in fact the number of sites that are using recaptcha is so high that the number of words that we 're digitizing per day is really really large it 's about 100 million a day which is the equivalent of about two and a half million books a year and this is all being done one word at a time by just people typing captchas on the internet now of course since we 're doing so many words per day funny things can happen and this is especially true because now we 're giving people two randomly chosen english words next to each other so funny things can happen for example we presented this word it 's the word " christians " there 's nothing wrong with it but if you present it along with another randomly chosen word bad things can happen so we get this but it 's even worse because the particular website where we showed this actually happened to be called the embassy of the kingdom of god oops here 's another really bad one johnedwards.com so we keep on insulting people left and right everyday now of course we 're not just insulting people see here 's the thing since we 're presenting two randomly chosen words interesting things can happen so this actually has given rise to a really big internet meme that tens of thousands of people have participated in which is called captcha art i 'm sure some of you have heard about it here 's how it works imagine you 're using the internet and you see a captcha that you think is somewhat peculiar like this captcha then what you 're supposed to do is you take a screen shot of it then of course you fill out the captcha because you help us digitize a book but then first you take a screen shot and then you draw something that is related to it that 's how it works there are tens of thousands of these some of them are very cute some of them are funnier and some of them like paleontological shvisle they contain snoop dogg okay so this is my favorite number of recaptcha so this is the favorite thing that i like about this whole project this is the number of distinct people that have helped us digitize at least one word out of a book through recaptcha 750 million which is a little over 10 percent of the world 's population has helped us digitize human knowledge and it is numbers like these that motivate my research agenda so the question that motivates my research is the following if you look at humanity 's large-scale achievements these really big things that humanity has gotten together and done historically [UNK] like for example building the pyramids of egypt or the panama canal or putting a man on the moon [UNK] there is a curious fact about them and it is that they were all done with about the same number off people it 's weird they were all done with about 100,000 people and the reason for that is because before the internet coordinating more than 100,000 people let alone paying them was essentially impossible but now with the internet i 've just shown you a project where we 've gotten 750 million people to help us digitize human knowledge so the question that motivates my research is if we can put a man on the moon with 100,000 what can we do with 100 million so based on this question we 've had a lot of different projects that we 've been working on let me tell you about one that i 'm most excited about this is something that we 've been semi-quietly working on for the last year and a half or so it has n't yet been launched it 's called duolingo since it has n't been launched shhhhh 1 yeah i can trust you 'll do that so this is the project here 's how it started it started with me posing a question to my graduate student severin hacker okay that 's severin hacker so i posed the question to my graduate student by the way you did hear me correctly his last name is hacker so i posed this question to him how can we get 100 million people translating the web into every major language for free okay so there 's a lot of things to say about this question first of all translating the web so right now the web is partitioned into multiple languages a large fraction of it is in english if you do n't know any english you ca n't access it but there 's large fractions in other different languages and if you do n't know those languages you ca n't access it so i would like to translate all of the web or at least most of the web into every major language so that 's what i would like to do now some of you may say why ca n't we use computers to translate why ca n't we use machine translation machine translation nowadays is starting to translate some sentences here and there why ca n't we use it to translate the whole web well the problem with that is that it 's not yet good enough and it probably wo n't be for the next 15 to 20 years it makes a lot of mistakes even when it does n't make a mistake since it makes so many mistakes you do n't know whether to trust it or not so let me show you an example of something that was translated with a machine actually it was a forum post it was somebody who was trying to ask a question about javascript it was translated from japanese into english so i 'll just let you read this person starts apologizing for the fact that it 's translated with a computer so the next sentence is is going to be the preamble to the question so he 's just explaining something remember it 's a question about javascript then comes the first part of the question then comes my favorite part of the question and then comes the ending which is my favorite part of the whole thing okay so computer translation not yet good enough so back to the question so we need people to translate the whole web so now the next question you may have is well why ca n't we just pay people to do this we could pay professional language translators to translate the whole web we could do that unfortunately it would be extremely expensive for example translating a tiny tiny fraction of the whole web wikipedia into one other language spanish wikipedia exists in spanish but it 's very small compared to the size of english it 's about 20 percent of the size of english if we wanted to translate the other 80 percent into spanish it would cost at least 50 million dollars [UNK] and this is at even the most exploited outsourcing country out there so it would be very expensive so what we want to do is we want to get 100 million people translating the web into every major language for free now if this is what you want to do you pretty quickly realize you 're going to run into two pretty big hurdles two big obstacles the first one is a lack of bilinguals so i do n't even know if there exists 100 million people out there using the web who are bilingual enough to help us translate that 's a big problem the other problem you 're going to run into is a lack of motivation how are we going to motivate people to actually translate the web for free normally you have to pay people to do this so how are we going to motivate them to do it for free now when we were starting to think about this we were blocked by these two things but then we realized there 's actually a way to solve both these problems with the same solution there 's a way to kill two birds with one stone and that is to transform language translation into something that millions of people want to do and that also helps with the problem of lack of bilinguals and that is language education so it turns out that today there are over 1.2 billion people learning a foreign language people really really want to learn a foreign language and it 's not just because they 're being forced to do so in school for example in the united states alone there are over five million people who have paid over $ 500 for software to learn a new language so people really really want to learn a new language so what we 've been working on for the last year and a half is a new website [UNK] it 's called duolingo [UNK] where the basic idea is people learn a new language for free while simultaneously translating the web and so basically they 're learning by doing so the way this works is whenever you 're a just a beginner we give you very very simple sentences there 's of course a lot of very simple sentences on the web we give you very very simple sentences along with what each word means and as you translate them and as you see how other people translate them you start learning the language and as you get more and more advanced we give you more and more complex sentences to translate but at all times you 're learning by doing now the crazy thing about this method is that it actually really works first of all people are really really learning a language we 're mostly done building it and now we 're testing it people really can learn a language with it and they learn it about as well as the leading language learning software so people really do learn a language and not only do they learn it as well but actually it 's way more interesting because you see with duolingo people are actually learning with real content as opposed to learning with made-up sentences people are learning with real content which is inherently interesting so people really do learn a language but perhaps more surprisingly the translations that we get from people using the site even though they 're just beginners the translations that we get are as accurate as those of professional language translators which is very surprising so let me show you one example this is a sentence that was translated from german into english the top is the german the middle is an english translation that was done by somebody who was a professional english translator who we paid 20 cents a word for this translation and the bottom is a translation by users of duolingo none of whom knew any german before they started using the site you can see it 's pretty much perfect now of course we play a trick here to make the translations as good as professional language translators we combine the translations of multiple beginners to get the quality of a single professional translator now even though we 're combining the translations the site actually can translate pretty fast so let me show you this is our estimates of how fast we could translate wikipedia from english into spanish remember this is 50 million dollars-worth of value so if we wanted to translate wikipedia into spanish we could do it in five weeks with 100,000 active users and we could do it in about 80 hours with a million active users since all the projects that my group has worked on so far have gotten millions of users we 're hopeful that we 'll be able to translate extremely fast with this project now the thing that i 'm most excited about with duolingo is i think this provides a fair business model for language education so here 's the thing the current business model for language education is the student pays and in particular the student pays rosetta stone 500 dollars that 's the current business model the problem with this business model is that 95 percent of the world 's population does n't have 500 dollars so it 's extremely unfair towards the poor this is totally biased towards the rich now see in duolingo because while you learn you 're actually creating value you 're translating stuff [UNK] which for example we could charge somebody for translations so this is how we could monetize this since people are creating value while they 're learning they do n't have to pay their money they pay with their time but the magical thing here is that they 're paying with their time but that is time that would have had to have been spent anyways learning the language so the nice thing about duolingo is i think it provides a fair business model [UNK] one that does n't discriminate against poor people so here 's the site thank you so here 's the site we have n't yet launched but if you go there you can sign up to be part of our private beta which is probably going to start in about three or four weeks we have n't yet launched this duolingo by the way i 'm the one talking here but actually duolingo is the work of a really awesome team some of whom are here so thank you .the world is changing with really remarkable speed if you look at the chart at the top here you 'll see that in 2025 these goldman sachs projections suggest that the chinese economy will be almost the same size as the american economy and if you look at the chart for 2050 it 's projected that the chinese economy will be twice the size of the american economy and the indian economy will be almost the same size as the american economy and we should bear in mind here that these projections were drawn up before the western financial crisis a couple of weeks ago i was looking at the latest projection by bnp paribas for when china will have a larger economy than the united states goldman sachs projected 2027 the post-crisis projection is 2020 that 's just a decade away china is going to change the world in two fundamental respects first of all it 's a huge developing country with a population of 1.3 billion people which has been growing for over 30 years at around 10 percent a year and within a decade it will have the largest economy in the world never before in the modern era has the largest economy in the world been that of a developing country rather than a developed country secondly for the first time in the modern era the dominant country in the world [UNK] which i think is what china will become [UNK] will be not from the west and from very very different civilizational roots now i know it 's a widespread assumption in the west that as countries modernize they also westernize this is an illusion it 's an assumption that modernity is a product simply of competition markets and technology it is not it is also shaped equally by history and culture china is not like the west and it will not become like the west it will remain in very fundamental respects very different now the big question here is obviously how do we make sense of china how do we try to understand what china is and the problem we have in the west at the moment by and large is that the conventional approach is that we understand it really in western terms using western ideas we ca n't now i want to offer you three building blocks for trying to understand what china is like just as a beginning the first is this that china is not really a nation-state okay it 's called itself a nation-state for the last hundred years but everyone who knows anything about china knows it 's a lot older than this this was what china looked like with the victory of the qin dynasty in 221 b.c at the end of the warring-state period [UNK] the birth of modern china and you can see it against the boundaries of modern china or immediately afterward the han dynasty still 2,000 years ago and you can see already it occupies most of what we now know as eastern china which is where the vast majority of chinese lived then and live now now what is extraordinary about this is what gives china its sense of being china what gives the chinese the sense of what it is to be chinese comes not from the last hundred years not from the nation-state period which is what happened in the west but from the period if you like of the civilization-state i 'm thinking here for example of customs like ancestral worship of a very distinctive notion of the state likewise a very distinctive notion of the family social relationships like guanxi confucian values and so on these are all things that come from the period of the civilization-state in other words china unlike the western states and most countries in the world is shaped by its sense of civilization its existence as a civilization-state rather than as a nation-state and there 's one other thing to add to this and that is this of course we know china 's big huge demographically and geographically with a population of 1.3 billion people what we often are n't really aware of is the fact that china is extremely diverse and very pluralistic and in many ways very decentralized you ca n't run a place on this scale simply from beijing even though we think this to be the case it 's never been the case so this is china a civilization-state rather than a nation-state and what does it mean well i think it has all sorts of profound implications i 'll give you two quick ones the first is that the most important political value for the chinese is unity is the maintenance of chinese civilization you know 2,000 years ago europe breakdown [UNK] the fragmentation of the holy roman empire it divided and it 's remained divided ever since china over the same time period went in exactly the opposite direction very painfully holding this huge civilization civilization-state together the second is maybe more prosaic which is hong kong do you remember the handover of hong kong by britain to china in 1997 you may remember what the chinese constitutional proposition was one country two systems and i 'll lay a wager that barely anyone in the west believed them " window dressing when china gets its hands on hong kong that wo n't be the case " thirteen years on the political and legal system in hong kong is as different now as it was in 1997 we were wrong why were we wrong we were wrong because we thought naturally enough in nation-state ways think of german unification 1990 what happened well basically the east was swallowed by the west one nation one system that is the nation-state mentality but you ca n't run a country like china a civilization-state on the basis of one civilization one system it does n't work so actually the response of china to the question of hong kong [UNK] as it will be to the question of taiwan [UNK] was a natural response one civilization many systems let me offer you another building block to try and understand china [UNK] maybe not sort of a comfortable one the chinese have a very very different conception of race to most other countries do you know of the 1.3 billion chinese over 90 percent of them think they belong to the same race the han now this is completely different from the world 's [ other ] most populous countries india the united states indonesia brazil [UNK] all of them are multiracial the chinese do n't feel like that china is only multiracial really at the margins so the question is why well the reason i think essentially is again back to the civilization-state a history of at least 2,000 years a history of conquest occupation absorption assimilation and so on led to the process by which over time this notion of the han emerged [UNK] of course nurtured by a growing and very powerful sense of cultural identity now the great advantage of this historical experience has been that without the han china could never have held together the han identity has been the cement which has held this country together the great disadvantage of it is that the han have a very weak conception of cultural difference they really believe in their own superiority and they are disrespectful of those who are not hence their attitude for example to the uyghurs and to the tibetans or let me give you my third building block the chinese state now the relationship between the state and society in china is very different from that in the west now we in the west overwhelmingly seem to think [UNK] in these days at least [UNK] that the authority and legitimacy of the state is a function of democracy the problem with this proposition is that the chinese state enjoys more legitimacy and more authority amongst the chinese than is true with any western state and the reason for this is because [UNK] well there are two reasons i think and it 's obviously got nothing to do with democracy because in our terms the chinese certainly do n't have a democracy and the reason for this is firstly because the state in china is given a very special [UNK] it enjoys a very special significance as the representative the embodiment and the guardian of chinese civilization of the civilization-state this is as close as china gets to a kind of spiritual role and the second reason is because whereas in europe and north america the state 's power is continuously challenged [UNK] i mean in the european tradition historically against the church against other sectors of the aristocracy against merchants and so on [UNK] for 1,000 years the power of the chinese state has not been challenged it 's had no serious rivals so you can see that the way in which power has been constructed in china is very different from our experience in western history the result by the way is that the chinese have a very different view of the state whereas we tend to view it as an intruder a stranger certainly an organ whose powers need to be limited or defined and constrained the chinese do n't see the state like that at all the chinese view the state as an intimate [UNK] not just as an intimate actually as a member of the family [UNK] not just in fact as a member of the family but as the head of the family the patriarch of the family this is the chinese view of the state [UNK] very very different to ours it 's embedded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case in the west and i would suggest to you that actually what we are dealing with here in the chinese context is a new kind of paradigm which is different from anything we 've had to think about in the past know that china believes in the market and the state i mean adam smith already writing in the late 18th century said " the chinese market is larger and more developed and more sophisticated than anything in europe " and apart from the mao period that has remained more or less the case ever since but this is combined with an extremely strong and ubiquitous state the state is everywhere in china i mean it 's leading firms [UNK] many of them are still publicly owned private firms however large they are like lenovo depend in many ways on state patronage targets for the economy and so on are set by the state and the state of course its authority flows into lots of other areas [UNK] as we are familiar with [UNK] with something like the one-child policy moreover this is a very old state tradition a very old tradition of statecraft i mean if you want an illustration of this the great wall is one but this is another this is the grand canal which was constructed in the first instance in the fifth century b.c and was finally completed in the seventh century a.d it went for 1,114 miles linking beijing with hangzhou and shanghai so there 's a long history of extraordinary state infrastructural projects in china which i suppose helps us to explain what we see today which is something like the three gorges dam and many other expressions of state competence within china so there we have three building blocks for trying to understand the difference that is china [UNK] the civilization-state the notion of race and the nature of the state and its relationship to society and yet we still insist by and large in thinking that we can understand china by simply drawing on western experience looking at it through western eyes using western concepts if you want to know why we unerringly seem to get china wrong [UNK] our predictions about what 's going to happen to china are incorrect [UNK] this is the reason unfortunately i think i have to say that i think attitude towards china is that of a kind of little westerner mentality it 's kind of arrogant it 's arrogant in the sense that we think that we are best and therefore we have the universal measure and secondly it 's ignorant we refuse to really address the issue of difference you know there 's a very interesting passage in a book by paul cohen the american historian and paul cohen argues that the west thinks of itself as probably the most cosmopolitan of all cultures but it 's not in many ways it 's the most parochial because for 200 years the west has been so dominant in the world that it 's not really needed to understand other cultures other civilizations because at the end of the day it could if necessary by force get its own way whereas those cultures [UNK] virtually the rest of the world in fact which have been in a far weaker position vis-a-vis the west [UNK] have been thereby forced to understand the west because of the west 's presence in those societies and therefore they are as a result more cosmopolitan in many ways than the west i mean take the question of east asia east asia japan korea china etc [UNK] a third of the world 's population lives there now the largest economic region in the world and i 'll tell you now that east asianers people from east asia are far more knowledgeable about the west than the west is about east asia now this point is very germane i 'm afraid to the present because what 's happening back to that chart at the beginning the goldman sachs chart what is happening is that very rapidly in historical terms the world is being driven and shaped not by the old developed countries but by the developing world we 've seen this in terms of the g20 usurping very rapidly the position of the g7 or the g8 and there are two consequences of this first the west is rapidly losing its influence in the world there was a dramatic illustration of this actually a year ago [UNK] copenhagen climate change conference europe was not at the final negotiating table when did that last happen i would wager it was probably about 200 years ago and that is what is going to happen in the future and the second implication is that the world will inevitably as a consequence become increasingly unfamiliar to us because it 'll be shaped by cultures and experiences and histories that we are not really familiar with or conversant with and at last i 'm afraid [UNK] take europe america is slightly different [UNK] but europeans by and large i have to say are ignorant are unaware about the way the world is changing some people [UNK] i 've got an english friend in china and he said " the continent is sleepwalking into oblivion " well maybe that 's true maybe that 's an exaggeration but there 's another problem which goes along with this [UNK] that europe is increasingly out of touch with the world [UNK] and that is a sort of loss of a sense of the future i mean europe once of course once commanded the future in its confidence take the 19th century for example but this alas is no longer true if you want to feel the future if you want to taste the future try china [UNK] there 's old confucius this is a railway station the likes of which you 've never seen before it does n't even look like a railway station this is the new guangzhou railway station for the high-speed trains china already has a bigger network than any other country in the world and will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together or take this now this is an idea but it 's an idea to be tried out shortly in a suburb of beijing here you have a megabus on the upper deck carries about 2,000 people it travels on rails down a suburban road and the cars travel underneath it and it does speeds of up to about 100 miles an hour now this is the way things are going to move because china has a very specific problem which is different from europe and different from the united states china has huge numbers of people and no space so this is a solution to a situation where china 's going to have many many many cities over 20 million people okay so how would i like to finish well what should our attitude be towards this world that we see very rapidly developing before us i think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it but i want to argue above all a big-picture positive for this world for 200 years the world was essentially governed by a fragment of the human population that 's what europe and north america represented the arrival of countries like china and india [UNK] between them 38 percent of the world 's population [UNK] and others like indonesia and brazil and so on represent the most important single act of democratization in the last 200 years civilizations and cultures which had been ignored which had no voice which were not listened to which were not known about will have a different sort of representation in this world as humanists we must welcome surely this transformation and we will have to learn about these civilizations this big ship here was the one sailed in by zheng he in the early 15th century on his great voyages around the south china sea the east china sea and across the indian ocean to east africa the little boat in front of it was the one in which 80 years later christopher columbus crossed the atlantic or look carefully at this silk scroll made by zhuzhou in 1368 i think they 're playing golf christ the chinese even invented golf welcome to the future thank you .i run a design studio in new york every seven years i close it for one year to pursue some little experiments things that are always difficult to accomplish during the regular working year in that year we are not available for any of our clients we are totally closed and as you can imagine it is a lovely and very energetic time i originally had opened the studio in new york to combine my two loves music and design and we created videos and packaging for many musicians that you know and for even more that you 've never heard of as i realized just like with many many things in my life that i actually love i adapt to it and i get over time bored by them and for sure in our case our work started to look the same you see here a glass eye in a die cut of a book quite the similar idea then a perfume packaged in a book in a die cut so i decided to close it down for one year also is the knowledge that right now we spend about in the first 25 years of our lives learning then there is another 40 years that 's really reserved for working and then tacked on at the end of it are about 15 years for retirement and i thought it might be helpful to basically cut off five of those retirement years and intersperse them in between those working years that 's clearly enjoyable for myself but probably even more important is that the work that comes out of these years flows back into the company and into society at large rather than just benefiting a grandchild or two there is a fellow tedster who spoke two years ago jonathan haidt who defined his work into three different levels and they rang very true for me i can see my work as a job i do it for money i likely already look forward to the weekend on thursdays and i probably will need a hobby as a leveling mechanism in a career i 'm definitely more engaged but at the same time there will be periods when i think is all that really hard work really worth my while while in the third one in the calling very much likely i would do it also if i would n't be financially compensated for it i am not a religious person myself but i did look for nature i had spent my first sabbatical in new york city looked for something different for the second one europe and the u.s. did n't really feel enticing because i knew them too well so asia it was the most beautiful landscapes i had seen in asia were sri lanka and bali sri lanka still had the civil war going on so bali it was it 's a wonderful very craft-oriented society i arrived there in september 2008 and pretty much started to work right away there is wonderful inspiration coming from the area itself however the first thing that i needed was mosquito repellent typography because they were definitely around heavily and then i needed some sort of way to be able to get back to all the wild dogs that surround my house and attacked me during my morning walks so we created this series of 99 portraits on tee shirts every single dog on one tee shirt as a little retaliation with a just ever so slightly menacing message on the back of the shirt just before i left new york i decided i could actually renovate my studio and then just leave it all to them and i do n't have to do anything so i looked for furniture and it turned out that all the furniture that i really liked i could n't afford and all the stuff i could afford i did n't like so one of the things that we pursued in bali was pieces of furniture this one of course still works with the wild dogs it 's not quite finished yet and i think by the time this lamp came about i had finally made peace with those dogs then there is a coffee table i also did a coffee table it 's called be here now it includes 330 compasses and we had custom espresso cups made that hide a magnet inside and make those compasses go crazy always centering on them then this is a fairly talkative verbose kind of chair i also started meditating for the first time in my life in bali and at the same time i 'm extremely aware how boring it is to hear about other people 's happinesses so i will not really go too far into it many of you will know this tedster danny gilbert whose book actually i got it through the ted book club i think it took me four years to finally read it while on sabbatical and i was pleased to see that he actually wrote the book while he was on sabbatical and i 'll show you a couple of people that did well by pursuing sabbaticals this is ferran adria many people think he is right now the best chef in the world with his restaurant north of barcelona el bulli his restaurant is open seven months every year he closes it down for five months to experiment with a full kitchen staff his latest numbers are fairly impressive he can seat throughout the year he can seat 8,000 people and he has 2.2 million requests for reservations if i look at my cycle seven years one year sabbatical it 's 12.5 percent of my time and if i look at companies that are actually more successful than mine 3m since the 1930s is giving all their engineers 15 percent to pursue whatever they want there is some good successes scotch tape came out of this program as well as art fry developed sticky notes from during his personal time for 3m google of course very famously gives 20 percent for their software engineers to pursue their own personal projects anybody in here has actually ever conducted a sabbatical that 's about five percent of everybody so i 'm not sure if you saw your neighbor putting their hand up talk to them about if it was successful or not i 've found that finding out about what i 'm going to like in the future my very best way is to talk to people who have actually done it much better than myself envisioning it when i had the idea of doing one the process was i made the decision and i put it into my daily planner book and then i told as many many people as i possibly could about it so that there was no way that i could chicken out later on in the beginning on the first sabbatical it was rather disastrous i had thought that i should do this without any plan that this vacuum of time somehow would be wonderful and enticing for idea generation it was not i just without a plan i just reacted to little requests not work requests those i all said no to but other little requests sending mail to japanese design magazines and things like that so i became my own intern and i very quickly made a list of the things i was interested in put them in a hierarchy divided them into chunks of time and then made a plan very much like in grade school what does it say here monday 8 to 9 story writing 9 to 10 future thinking was not very successful and so on and so forth and that actually specifically as a starting point of the first sabbatical worked really well for me what came out of it i really got close to design again i had fun financially seen over the long term it was actually successful because of the improved quality we could ask for higher prices and probably most importantly basically everything we 've done in the seven years following the first sabbatical came out of thinking of that one single year and i 'll show you a couple of projects that came out of the seven years following that sabbatical one of the strands of thinking i was involved in was that sameness is so incredibly overrated this whole idea that everything needs to be exactly the same works for a very very few strand of companies and not for everybody else we were asked to design an identity for casa da musica the rem koolhaas-built music center in porto in portugal and even though i desired to do an identity that does n't use the architecture i failed at that and mostly also because i realized out of a rem koolhaas presentation to the city of porto where he talked about a conglomeration of various layers of meaning which i understood after i translated it from architecture speech in to regular english basically as logo making and i understood that the building itself was a logo so then it became quite easy we put a mask on it looked at it deep down in the ground checked it out from all sides west north south east top and bottom colored them in a very particular way by having a friend of mine write a piece of software the casa da musica logo generator that 's connected to a scanner you put any image in there like that beethoven image and the software in a second will give you the casa da musica beethoven logo which when you actually have to design a beethoven poster comes in handy because the visual information of the logo and the actual poster is exactly the same so it will always fit together conceptually of course if zappa 's music is performed it gets its own logo or philip glass or lou reed or the chemical brothers who all performed there get their own casa da musica logo it works the same internally with the president or the musical director whose casa da musica portraits wind up on their business cards there is a full-blown orchestra living inside the building it has a more transparent identity the truck they go on tour with or there 's a smaller contemporary orchestra 12 people that remixes its own title and one of the handy things that came about was that you could take the logo type and create advertising out of it like this donna toney poster or chopin or mozart or la monte young you can take the shape and make typography out of it you can grow it underneath the skin you can have a poster for a family event in front of the house or a rave underneath the house or a weekly program as well as educational services second insight so far until that point i had been mostly involved or used the language of design for promotional purposes which was fine with me on one hand i have nothing against selling my parents are both salespeople but i did feel that i spent so much time learning this language why do i only promote with it there must be something else and the whole series of work came out of it some of you might have seen it i showed some of it at earlier teds before under the title " things i 've learned in my life so far " i 'll just show two now this is a whole wall of bananas at different ripenesses on the opening day in this gallery in new york it says " self-confidence produces fine results " this is after a week after two weeks three weeks four weeks five weeks and you see the self confidence almost comes back but not quite these are some pictures visitors sent to me and then the city of amsterdam gave us a plaza and asked us to do something we used the stone plates as a grid for our little piece we got 250,000 coins from the central bank at different darknesses so we got brand new ones shiny ones medium ones and very old dark ones and with the help of 100 volunteers over a week created this fairly floral typography that spelled " obsessions make my life worse and my work better " and the idea of course was to make the type so precious that as an audience you would be in between " should i really take as much money as i can or should i leave the piece intact as it is right now " while we built all this up during that week with the 100 volunteers a good number of the neighbors surrounding the plaza got very close to it and quite loved it so when it was finally done and in the first night a guy came with big plastic bags and scooped up as many coins as he could possibly carry one of the neighbors called the police and the amsterdam police in all their wisdom came saw and they wanted to protect the artwork and they swept it all up and put it into custody at police headquarters i think you see you see them sweeping you see them sweeping right here that 's the police getting rid of it all so after eight hours that 's pretty much all that was left of the whole thing we are also working on the start of a bigger project in bali it 's a movie about happiness and here we asked some nearby pigs to do the titles for us they were n't quite slick enough so we asked the goose to do it again and hoped she would do somehow a more elegant or pretty job and i think she overdid it just a bit too ornamental and my studio is very close to the monkey forest and the monkeys in that monkey forest looked actually fairly happy so we asked those guys to do it again they did a fine job but had a couple of readability problems so of course whatever you do n't really do yourself does n't really get done properly that film we 'll be working on for the next two years so it 's going to be a while and of course you might think that doing a film on happiness might not really be worthwhile then you can of course always go and see this guy video and i 'm happy i 'm alive i 'm happy i 'm alive i 'm happy i 'm alive stefan sagmeister thank you .my name is arvind gupta and i 'm a toymaker i 've been making toys for the last 30 years the early '70s i was in college it was a very revolutionary time it was a political ferment so to say [UNK] students out in the streets of paris revolting against authority america was jolted by the anti-vietnam movement the civil rights movement in india we had the naxalite movement the [ unclear ] movement but you know when there is a political churning of society it unleashes a lot of energy the national movement of india was testimony to that lots of people resigned from well-paid jobs and jumped into the national movement now in the early '70s one of the great programs in india was to revitalize primary science in village schools there was a person anil sadgopal did a ph.d. from caltech and returned back as a molecular biologist in india 's cutting-edge research institute the tifr at 31 he was not able to relate the kind of [ unclear ] research which he was doing with the lives of the ordinary people so he designed and went and started a village science program many people were inspired by this the slogan of the early '70s was " go to the people live with them love them start from what they know build on what they have " this was kind of the defining slogan well i took one year i joined telco made tata trucks pretty close to pune i worked there for two years and i realized that i was not born to make trucks often one does n't know what one wants to do but it 's good enough to know what you do n't want to do so i took one year off and i went to this village science program and it was a turning point it was a very small village [UNK] a weekly bazaar where people just once in a week they put in all the vats so i said " i 'm going to spend a year over here " so i just bought one specimen of everything which was sold on the roadside and one thing which i found was this black rubber this is called a cycle valve tube when you pump in air in a bicycle you use a bit of this and some of these models [UNK] so you take a bit of this cycle valve tube you can put two matchsticks inside this and you make a flexible joint it 's a joint of tubes you start by teaching angles [UNK] an acute angle a right angle an obtuse angle a straight angle it 's like its own little coupling if you have three of them and you loop them together well you make a triangle with four you make a square you make a pentagon you make a hexagon you make all these kind of polygons and they have some wonderful properties if you look at the hexagon for instance it 's like an amoeba which is constantly changing its own profile you can just pull this out this becomes a rectangle you give it a push this becomes a parallelogram but this is very shaky look at the pentagon for instance pull this out [UNK] it becomes a boat shape trapezium push it and it becomes house shaped this becomes an isosceles triangle [UNK] again very shaky this square might look very square and prim give it a little push [UNK] this becomes a rhombus it becomes kite-shaped but give a child a triangle he ca n't do a thing to it why use triangles because triangles are the only rigid structures we ca n't make a bridge with squares because the train would come it would start doing a jig ordinary people know about this because if you go to a village in india they might not have gone to engineering college but no one makes a roof placed like this because if they put tiles on top it 's just going to crash they always make a triangular roof now this is people science and if you were to just poke a hole over here and put a third matchstick you 'll get a t joint and if i were to poke all the three legs of this in the three vertices of this triangle i would make a tetrahedron so you make all these 3d shapes you make a tetrahedron like this and once you make these you make a little house put this on top you can make a joint of four you can make a joint of six you just need a ton now this was [UNK] you make a joint of six you make an icosahedron you can play around with it this makes an igloo now this is in 1978 i was a 24-year-old young engineer and i thought this was so much better than making trucks if you as a matter of fact put four marbles inside you simulate the molecular structure of methane ch4 four atoms of hydrogen the four points of the tetrahedron which means the little carbon atom well since then i just thought that i 've been really privileged to go to over 2,000 schools in my country [UNK] village schools government schools municipal schools ivy league schools [UNK] i 've been invited by most of them and every time i go to a school i see a gleam in the eyes of the children i see hope i see happiness in their faces children want to make things children want to do things now this we make lots and lots of pumps now this is a little pump with which you could inflate a balloon it 's a real pump you could actually pop the balloon and we have a slogan that the best thing a child can do with a toy is to break it it 's a very kind of provocative statement [UNK] this old bicycle tube and this old plastic [ unclear ] this filling cap will go very snugly into an old bicycle tube and this is how you make a valve you put a little sticky tape this is one-way traffic well we make lots and lots of pumps and this is the other one [UNK] that you just take a straw and you just put a stick inside and you make two half-cuts is you bend both these legs into a triangle and you just wrap some tape around and this is the pump and now if you have this pump it 's like a great great sprinkler it 's like a centrifuge if you spin something it tends to fly out well in terms of [UNK] if you were in andhra pradesh you would make this with the palmyra leaf many of our folk toys have great science principles if you spin-top something it tends to fly out if i do it with both hands you can see this fun mr flying man right this is a toy which is made from paper it 's amazing there are four pictures you see insects you see frogs snakes eagles butterflies frogs snakes eagles here 's a paper which you could [ unclear ] [UNK] designed by a mathematician at harvard in 1928 arthur stone documented by martin gardner in many of his many books but this is great fun for children they all study about the food chain the insects are eaten by the frogs the frogs are eaten by the snakes the snakes are eaten by the eagles and this can be if you had a whole photocopy paper [UNK] a4 size paper [UNK] you could be in a municipal school you could be in a government school [UNK] a paper a scale and a pencil [UNK] no glue no scissors in three minutes you just fold this up and what you could use it for is just limited by your imagination if you take a smaller paper you make a smaller flexagon with a bigger one you make a bigger one now this is a pencil with a few slots over here and you put a little fan here and this is a hundred-year-old toy there have been six major research papers on this there 's some grooves over here you can see and if i take a reed [UNK] if i rub this something very amazing happens six major research papers on this as a matter of fact feynman as a child was very fascinated by this he wrote a paper on this and you do n't need the three billion-dollar hadron collider for doing this this is there for every child and every child can enjoy this if you want to put a colored disk well all these seven colors coalesce and this is what newton talked about 400 years back that white light 's made of seven colors just by spinning this around this is a straw what we 've done we 've just sealed both the ends with tape nipped the right corner and the bottom left corner so there 's holes in the opposite corners there 's a little hole over here this is a kind of a blowing straw i just put this inside this there 's a hole here and i shut this and this costs very little money to make [UNK] great fun for children to do what we do is make a very simple electric motor now this is the simplest motor on earth the most expensive thing is the battery inside this if you have a battery it costs five cents to make it this is an old bicycle tube which gives you a broad rubber band two safety pins this is a permanent magnet whenever current flows through the coil this becomes an electromagnet it 's the interaction of both these magnets which makes this motor spin we made 30,000 teachers who have been teaching science for donkey years they just muck up the definition and they spit it out when teachers make it children make it you can see a gleam in their eye they get a thrill of what science is all about and this science is not a rich man 's game in a democratic country science must reach to our most oppressed to the most marginalized children this program started with 16 schools and spread to 1,500 government schools over 100,000 children learn science this way and we 're just trying to see possibilities look this is the tetrapak [UNK] awful materials from the point of view of the environment there are six layers [UNK] three layers of plastic aluminum [UNK] which are are sealed together they are fused together so you ca n't separate them now you can just make a little network like this and fold them and stick them together and make an icosahedron so something which is trash which is choking all the seabirds you could just recycle this into a very very joyous [UNK] all the platonic solids can be made with things like this this is a little straw and what you do is you just nip two corners here and this becomes like a baby crocodile 's mouth you put this in your mouth and you blow it 's children 's delight a teacher 's envy as they say you 're not able to see how the sound is produced because the thing which is vibrating goes inside my mouth i 'm going to keep this outside to blow out i 'm going to suck in air so no one actually needs to muck up the production of sound with wire vibrations the other is that you keep blowing at it keep making the sound and you keep cutting it and something very very nice happens and when you get a very small one [UNK] this is what the kids teach you you can also do this well before i go any further this is something worth sharing this is a touching slate meant for blind children this is strips of velcro this is my drawing slate and this is my drawing pen which is basically a film box it 's basically like a fisherman 's line a fishing line and this is wool over here if i crank the handle all the wool goes inside and what a blind child can do is to just draw this wool sticks on velcro there are 12 million blind children in our country [UNK] who live in a world of darkness and this has come as a great boon to them there 's a factory out there making our children blind not able to provide them with food not able to provide them with vitamin a but this has come as a great boon for them there are no patents anyone can make it this is very very simple you can see this is the generator it 's a crank generator these are two magnets this is a large pulley made by sandwiching rubber between two old cds small pulley and two strong magnets and this fiber turns a wire attached to an led if i spin this pulley the small one 's going to spin much faster there will be a spinning magnetic field lines of course would be cut the force will be generated and you can see this led is going to glow so this is a small crank generator well this is again it 's just a ring a steel ring with steel nuts and what you can do is just if you give it a twirl well they just keep going on and imagine a bunch of kids standing in a circle and just waiting for the steel ring to be passed on and they 'd be absolutely joyous playing with this well in the end what we can also do we use a lot of old newspapers to make caps this is worthy of sachin tendulkar it 's a great cricket cap when first you see nehru and gandhi this is the nehru cap [UNK] just half a newspaper we make lots of toys with newspapers and this is one of them and this is [UNK] you can see [UNK] this is a flapping bird all of our old newspapers we cut them into little squares and if you have one of these birds [UNK] children in japan have been making this bird for many many years and you can see this is a little fantail bird well in the end i 'll just end with a story this is called " the captain 's hat story " the captain was a captain of a sea-going ship it goes very slowly and there were lots of passengers on the ship and they were getting bored so the captain invited them on the deck " wear all your colorful clothes and sing and dance and i 'll provide you with good food and drinks " and the captain would wear a cap everyday and join in the regalia the first day it was a huge umbrella cap like a captain 's cap that night when the passengers would be sleeping he would give it one more fold and the second day he would be wearing a fireman 's cap [UNK] with a little shoot just like a designer cap because it protects the spinal cord and the second night he would take the same cap and give it another fold and the third day it would be a shikari cap [UNK] just like an adventurer 's cap and the third night he would give it two more folds [UNK] and this is a very very famous cap if you 've seen any of our bollywood films this is what the policeman wears it 's called a zapalu cap it 's been catapulted to international glory and we must not forget that he was the captain of the ship so that 's a ship and now the end everyone was enjoying the journey very much they were singing and dancing suddenly there was a storm and huge waves and all the ship can do is to dance and pitch along with the waves a huge wave comes and slaps the front and knocks it down and another one comes and slaps the aft and knocks it down and there 's a third one over here this swallows the bridge and knocks it down and the ship sinks and the captain has lost everything but for a life jacket thank you so much .thank you i have two missions here today the first is to tell you something about pollen i hope and to convince you that it 's more than just something that gets up your nose and secondly to convince you that every home really ought to have a scanning electron microscope pollen is a flower 's way of making more flowers it carries male sex cells from one flower to another this gives us genetic diversity or at least it gives the plants genetic diversity and it 's really rather better not to mate with yourself that 's probably true of humans as well mostly pollen is produced by the anthers of flowers each anther can carry up to 100,000 grains of pollen so it 's quite prolific stuff and it is n't just bright flowers that have pollen it 's also trees and grasses and remember that all our cereal crops are grasses as well here is a scanning electron micrograph of a grain of pollen the little hole in the middle we 'll come to a bit later but that 's for the pollen tube to come out later on a very tiny tube so that 's 20 micrometers across that pollen grain there that 's about a 50th of a millimeter but not all pollen is quite so simple looking this is morina this is a plant [UNK] which i 've always thought to be rather tedious [UNK] named after morin who was an enterprising french gardener who issued the first seed catalog in 1621 but anyway take a look at its pollen this is amazing i think that little hole in the middle there is for the pollen tube and when the pollen finds its special female spot in another morina flower just on the right species what happens like i said pollen carries the male sex cells if you actually did n't realize that plants have sex they have rampant promiscuous and really quite interesting and curious sex really a lot my story is actually not about plant propagation but about pollen itself " so what are pollen 's properties " i hear you ask first of all pollen is tiny yes we know that it 's also very biologically active as anyone with hay fever will understand now pollen from plants which are wind-dispersed [UNK] like trees and grasses and so on [UNK] tend to cause the most hay fever and the reason for that is they 've got to chuck out masses and masses of pollen to have any chance of the pollen reaching another plant of the same species here are some examples [UNK] they 're very smooth if you look at them [UNK] of tree pollen that is meant to be carried by the wind again [UNK] this time sycamore [UNK] wind-dispersed so trees very boring flowers not really trying to attract insects cool pollen though this one i particularly like this is the monterey pine which has little air sacks to make the pollen carry even further remember that thing is just about 30 micrometers across now it 's much more efficient if you can get insects to do your bidding this is a bee 's leg with the pollen glommed onto it from a mallow plant and this is the outrageous and beautiful flower of the mangrove palm very showy to attract lots of insects to do its bidding the pollen has little barbs on it if we look now those little barbs obviously stick to the insects well but there is something else that we can tell from this photograph and that is that you might be able to see a fracture line across what would be the equator of this if it was the earth that tells me that it 's actually been fossilized this pollen and i 'm rather proud to say that this was found just near london and that 55 million years ago london was full of mangroves is n't that cool okay so this is another species evolved to be dispersed by insects you can tell that from the little barbs on there all these pictures were taken with a scanning electron microscope actually in the lab at kew laboratories no coincidence that these were taken by rob kesseler who is an artist and i think it 's someone with a design and artistic eye like him that has managed to bring out the best in pollen now all this diversity means that you can look at a pollen grain and tell what species it came from and that 's actually quite handy if you maybe have a sample and you want to see where it came from so different species of plants grow in different places and some pollen carries further than others so if you have a pollen sample then in principle you should be able to tell where that sample came from and this is where it gets interesting for forensics pollen is tiny it gets on to things and it sticks to them so not only does each type of pollen look different but each habitat has a different combination of plants a different pollen signature if you like or a different pollen fingerprint by looking at the proportions and combinations of different kinds of pollen in a sample you can tell very precisely where it came from this is some pollen embedded in a cotton shirt similar to the one that i 'm wearing now now much of the pollen will still be there after repeated washings where has it been four very different habitats might look similar but they 've got very different pollen signatures actually this one is particularly easy these pictures were all taken in different countries but pollen forensics can be very subtle it 's being used now to track where counterfeit drugs have been made where banknotes have come from to look at the provenance of antiques and see that they really did come from the place the seller said they did and murder suspects have been tracked using their clothing certainly in the u.k. to within an area that 's small enough that you can send in tracker dogs to find the murder victim so you can tell from a piece of clothing to within about a kilometer or so where that piece of clothing has been recently and then send in dogs and finally in a rather grizzly way the bosnia war crimes some of the people brought to trial were brought to trial because of the evidence from pollen which showed that bodies had been buried exhumed and then reburied somewhere else i hope i 've opened your eyes if you 'll excuse the visual pun to some of pollen 's secrets this is a horse chestnut there is an invisible beauty all around us each grain with a story to tell 1 each of us in fact with a story to tell from the pollen fingerprint that 's upon us thank you to the colleagues at kew and thank you to palynologists everywhere .some of you have heard the story before but in fact there 's somebody in the audience who 's never heard this story [UNK] in front of an audience [UNK] before so i 'm a little more nervous than i normally am telling this story i used to be a photographer for many years in 1978 i was working for time magazine and i was given a three-day assignment to photograph amerasian children children who had been fathered by american gis all over southeast asia and then abandoned [UNK] 40,000 children all over asia i had never heard the word amerasian before i spent a few days photographing children in different countries and like a lot of photographers and a lot of journalists i always hope that when my pictures were published they might actually have an effect on a situation instead of just documenting it so i was so disturbed by what i saw and i was so unhappy with the article that ran afterwards that i decided i would take six months off i was 28 years old i decided i would find six children in different countries and actually go spend some time with the kids and try to tell their story a little bit better than i thought i had done for time magazine in the course of doing the story i was looking for children who had n't been photographed before and the pearl buck foundation told me that they worked with a lot of americans who were donating money to help some of these kids and a man told me who ran the pearl buck foundation in korea that there was a young girl who was 11 years old being raised by her grandmother and the grandmother had never let any westerners ever see her every time any westerners came to the village she hid the girl and of course i was immediately intrigued i saw photographs of her and i thought i wanted to go and the guy just told me " there 's no way this grandmother wo n't even [UNK] you know there 's no way she 's ever going to let you meet this girl that 's she 's raising " i took a translator with me and went to this village found the grandmother sat down with her and to my astonishment she agreed to let me photograph her granddaughter and i was paying for this myself so i asked the translator if it would be ok if i stayed for the week i had a sleeping bag the family had a small shed on the side of the house so i said " could i sleep in my sleeping bag in the evenings " and i just told the little girl whose name was hyun-sook lee that if i ever did anything to embarrass her [UNK] she did n't speak a word of english although she looked very american [UNK] she could just put up her hand and say " stop " and i would stop taking pictures and then my translator left so there i was i could n't speak a word of korean and this is the first night i met hyun-sook her mother was still alive her mother was not raising her her grandmother was raising her and what struck me immediately was how in love the two of these people were the grandmother was incredibly fond deeply in love with this little girl they slept on the floor at night the way they heat their homes in korea is to put bricks under the floors so the heat actually radiates from underneath the floor hyun-sook was 11 years old i had photographed as i said a lot of these kids hyun-sook was in fact the fifth child that i found to photograph and almost universally amongst all the kids they were really psychologically damaged by having been made fun of ridiculed picked on and been rejected and korea was probably the place i found to be the worst for these kids and what struck me immediately in meeting hyun-sook was how confident she appeared to be how happy she seemed to be in her own skin and remember this picture because i 'm going to show you another picture later but you can see how much she looks like her grandmother although she looks so western i decided to follow her to school this is the first morning i stayed with her this is on the way to school this is the morning assembly outside her school and i noticed that she was clowning around when the teachers would ask questions she 'd be the first person to raise her hand again not at all shy or withdrawn or anything like the other children that i 'd photographed again the first one to go to the blackboard to answer questions getting in trouble for whispering into her best friend 's ears in the middle of class and one of the other things that i said to her through the translator [UNK] again this thing about saying stop [UNK] was to not pay attention to me and so she really just completely ignored me most of the time i noticed that at recess she was the girl who picked the other girls to be on her team it was very obvious from the very beginning that she was a leader this is on the way home and that 's north korea up along the hill this is up along the dmz they would actually cover the windows every night so that light could n't be seen because the south korean government has said for years that the north koreans may invade at any time so there 's always this [UNK] the closer you were to north korea the more terrifying it was very often at school i 'd be taking pictures and she would whisper into her girlfriends ' ears and then look at me and say " stop " and i would stand at attention and all the girls would crack up and it was sort of a little joke the end of the week came and my translator came back because i 'd asked her to come back so i could formally thank the grandmother and hyun-sook and in the course of the grandmother talking to the translator the grandmother started crying and i said to my translator " what 's going on why is she crying " and she spoke to the grandmother for a moment and then she started getting tears in her eyes and i said " ok what did i do what 's going on why is everyone crying " and the translator said " the grandmother says that she thinks she 's dying and she wants to know if you would take hyun-sook to america with you " and i said " i 'm 28 years old and i live in hotels and i 'm not married " i mean i had fallen in love with this girl but i [UNK] you know it was like emotionally i was about 12 years old if you know of photographers the joke is it 's the finest form of delayed adolescence ever invented " sorry i have to go on an assignment i 'll be back " [UNK] and then you never come back so i asked the translator why she thought she was dying can i get her to a hospital could i pay to get her a doctor and she refused any help at all and so when i got outside i actually gave the translator some money and said " please go back and see if you can do something " and i gave the grandmother my business card and i said " if you 're serious i will try to find a family for her " and i immediately wrote a letter to my best friends in atlanta georgia who had an 11-year-old son and my best friend had mistakenly one day said something about wishing he had another child so here my friends gene and gail had not heard from me in about a year and suddenly i was calling saying " i 'm in korea and i 've met this extraordinary girl " and i said " the grandmother thinks she 's sick but i think maybe we would have to bring the grandmother over also " and i said " i 'll pay for the 1 " i mean i had this whole sort of picture so anyway i left and my friends actually said they were very interested in adopting her and i said " look i think i 'll scare the grandmother to death if i actually write to her and tell her that you 're willing to adopt her i want to go back and talk to her " but i was off on assignment i figured i 'd come back in a couple of weeks and talk to the grandmother and on christmas day i was in bangkok with a group of photographers and got a telegram [UNK] back in those days you got telegrams [UNK] from time magazine saying someone in korea had died and left their child in a will to me did i know anything about this because i had n't told them what i was doing because i was so upset with the story they 'd run so i went back to korea and i went back to hyun-sook 's village and she was gone and the house that i had spent time in was empty it was incredibly cold no one in the village would tell me where hyun-sook was because the grandmother had always hidden her from westerners and they had no idea about this request that she 'd made of me so i finally found myung sung her best friend that she used to play with after school every day and myung sung under some pressure from me and the translator gave us an address on the outside of seoul and i went to that address and knocked on the door and a man answered the door it was not a very nice area of seoul as there were mud streets outside of it and i knocked on the door and hyun-sook answered the door and her eyes were bloodshot and she seemed to be in shock she did n't recognize me [UNK] there was no recognition whatsoever and this man came to the door and kind of barked something in korean and i said to the translator " what did he say " and she said " he wants to know who you are " and i said " well tell him that i am a photographer " i started explaining who i was and he interrupted and she said " he says he knows who you are what do you want " i said " well tell him that i was asked by this little girl 's grandmother to find a family for her " and he said " i 'm her uncle she 's fine you can leave now " so i was [UNK] you know the door was being slammed in my face it 's incredibly cold and i 'm trying to think " what would the hero do in a movie if i was writing this as a movie script " so i said " listen it 's really cold i 've come a very long way do you mind if i just come in for a minute i 'm freezing " so the guy kind of reluctantly let us in and we sat down on the floor and as we started talking i saw him yell something and hyun-sook came and brought us some food and i had this whole mental picture of sort of like cinderella i sort of had this picture of this incredibly wonderful bright happy little child who now appeared to be very withdrawn being enslaved by this family and i was really appalled and i could n't figure out what to do and the more i tried talking to him the less friendly he was getting so i finally decided i said " look " [UNK] this is all through the translator because this is all you know i do n't speak a word of korean [UNK] and i said " look i 'm really glad that hyun-sook has a family to live with i was very worried about her i made a promise to her grandmother your mother that i would find a family and now i 'm so happy that you 're going to take care of her " i said " but you know i bought an airline ticket and i 'm stuck here for a week " and i said " i 'm staying in a hotel downtown would you like to come and have lunch tomorrow and you can practice your english " because he told me [UNK] i was trying to ask him questions about himself and so i went to the hotel and i found two older amerasians a girl whose mother had been a prostitute and she was a prostitute and a boy who 'd been in and out of jail and i said to them " look there 's a little girl who has a tiny chance of getting out of here and going to america " i said " i do n't know if it 's the right decision or not but i would like you to come to lunch tomorrow and tell the uncle what it 's like to walk down the street what people say to you what you do for a living and just [UNK] i want him to understand what happens if she stays here and i could be wrong i do n't know but i wish you would come tomorrow " so these two came to lunch and we got thrown out of the restaurant they were yelling at him they were [UNK] it got to be really ugly and we went outside and he was just furious and i knew i had totally blown this whole thing here i was again trying to figure out what to do and he started yelling at me and i said to the translator " ok tell him to calm down what is he saying " and she said " well he 's saying 'who the hell are you to walk into my house some rich american with your cameras around your neck accusing me of enslaving my niece this is my niece i love her she 's my sister 's daughter who the hell are you to accuse me of something like this ' " and i said you know " look " i said " you 're absolutely right i do n't pretend to understand what 's going on here " i said " all i know is i 've been photographing a lot of these children " i said " i 'm in love with your niece i think she 's an incredibly special child " and i said " look i will fly my friends over here from the united states if you want to meet them to see if you approve of them i just think that [UNK] what little i know about the situation she has very little chance here of having the kind of life that you probably would like her to have " so everyone told me afterwards that inviting the prospective parents over was again the stupidest thing i could have possibly done because who 's ever good enough for your relative but he invited me to come to a ceremony they were having that day for her grandmother and they actually take items of clothing and photographs and they burn them as part of the ritual and you can see how different she looks just in three months this was now i think february early february and the pictures before were taken in september well there was an american marine priest that i had met in the course of doing the story who had 75 children living in his house he had three women helping him take care of these kids and so i suggested to the uncle that we go down and meet father keene to find out how the adoption process worked because i wanted him to feel like this was all being done very much above board so this is on the way down to the orphanage this is father keene he 's just a wonderful guy he had kids from all over korea living there and he would find families for these kids this is a social worker interviewing hyun-sook now i had always thought she was completely untouched by all of this because the grandmother to me appeared to be sort of the village wise woman and the person everybody [UNK] throughout the day i noticed people kept coming to visit her grandmother and i always had this mental picture that even though they may have been one of the poorer families in the village they were one of the most respected families in the village and i always felt that the grandmother had kind of demanded and insisted that the villagers treat hyun-sook with the same respect they treated her hyun-sook stayed at father keene 's and her uncle agreed to let her stay there until the adoption went through he actually agreed to the adoption and i went off on assignment and came back a week later and father keene said " i 've got to talk to you about hyun-sook " i kind of said " oh god now what " and he takes me into this room and he closes the door and he says " i have 75 children here in the orphanage and it 's total bedlam " and there 's clothes and there 's kids and you know there 's three adults and 75 kids [UNK] you can imagine and he said " the second day she was here she made up a list of all of the names of the older kids and the younger kids and she assigned one of the older kids to each of the younger kids and then she set up a work detail list of who cleaned the orphanage on what day " and he said " she 's telling me that i 'm messy and i have to clean up my room " and he said " i do n't know who raised her but " he said " she 's running the orphanage and she 's been here three days " this was movie day [UNK] that she organized [UNK] where all the kids went to the movies a lot of the kids who had been adopted actually wrote back to the other kids telling them about what their life was like with their new families so it was a really big deal when the letters showed up this is a woman who is now working at the orphanage whose son had been adopted gene and gail started studying korean the moment they had gotten my first letter they really wanted to be able to welcome hyun-sook into their family and one of the things father keene told me when i came back from one of these trips [UNK] hyun-sook had chosen the name natasha which i understood was from her watching a " rocky and bullwinkle " cartoon on the american air force station this may be one of those myth-buster things that we 'll have to clear up here in a minute so my friend gene flew over with his son tim gail could n't come and they spent a lot of time huddled over a dictionary and this was gene showing the uncle where atlanta was on the map where he lived this is the uncle signing the adoption papers now we went out to dinner that night to celebrate the uncle went back to his family and natasha and tim and gene and i went out to dinner and gene was showing natasha how to use a knife and fork and then natasha was returning the utensil lessons we went back to our hotel room and gene was showing natasha also where atlanta was this is the third night we were in korea the first night we 'd gotten a room for the kids right next to us now i 'd been staying in this room for about three months [UNK] it was a little 15-story korean hotel so the second night we did n't keep the kids ' room because we went down and slept on the floor with all the kids at the orphanage and the third night we came back we 'd just gone out to dinner where you saw the pictures and we got to the front desk and the guy at the front desk said " there 's no other free rooms on your floor tonight so if you want to put the kids five floors below you there 's a room there " and gene and i looked at each other and said " no we do n't want two 11-year-olds five floors away " so his son said " dad i have a sleeping bag i 'll sleep on the floor " and i said " yeah i have one too " so tim and i slept on the floor natasha got one bed gene got the other [UNK] kids pass out it 's been very exciting for three days we 're lying in bed and gene and i are talking about how cool we are we said " that was so great we saved this little girl 's life " we were just like you know ah just full of ourselves and we fall asleep [UNK] and i 've been in this room you know for a couple of months now and they always overheat the hotels in korea terribly so during the day i always left the window open and then at night about midnight they turn the heat off in the hotel so at about 1 a.m. the whole room would be like 20 below zero and i 'd get up i 'd been doing this every night i 'd been there so sure enough it 's one o'clock room 's freezing i go to close the window and i hear people shouting outside and i thought " oh the bars must have just gotten out " and i do n't speak korean but i 'm hearing these voices and i 'm not hearing anger i 'm hearing terror so i open the window and i look out and there 's flames coming up the side of our hotel and the hotel 's on fire so i run over to gene and i wake him up and i say " gene do n't freak out i think the hotel 's on fire " and now there 's smoke and flames coming by our windows [UNK] we 're on the eleventh floor so the two of us were just like " oh my god oh my god " so we 're trying to get natasha up and we ca n't talk to her and you know what kids are like when they 've been asleep for like an hour it 's like they took five valiums [UNK] you know they 're all over the place and we ca n't talk to her i remember his son had the l.l bean bootlaces and we 're trying to do up his laces so we try to get to the door and we run to the door and we open the door and it 's like walking into a blast furnace there 's people screaming there 's the sound of glass breaking there 's these weird thumps and the whole room filled with smoke in about two seconds and gene turns around and says " we 're not going to make it " and he closes the door and the whole room is now filled with smoke we 're all choking and there 's smoke pouring through the vents under the doors there 's people screaming i just remember this unbelievable just utter chaos i remember sitting near the bed and i was just so [UNK] i had two overwhelming feelings one was absolute terror [UNK] it 's like " oh please god i just want to wake up this has got to be a nightmare this ca n't be happening please i just want to wake up it 's got to be a nightmare " and the other is unbelievable guilt here i 've been playing god with my friends ' lives my friends ' son with natasha 's life and this what you get when you try playing god is you hurt people i remember just being so frightened and terrified and gene who 's lying on the floor says " man we 've got to soak towels " i said " what " he says " we 've got to soak towels we 're going to die from the smoke " so we ran to the bathroom and got towels and put them over our faces and the kids faces then he said " do you have gaffer 's tape " i said " what " he said " do you have gaffer 's tape " i said " yeah somewhere in my halliburton " he says " we 've got to stop the smoke " he said " that 's all we can do we 've got to stop the smoke " i mean gene [UNK] thank god for gene so we put the room service menus over the vents in the wall we put blankets at the bottom of the door we put the kids on the windowsill to try to get some air and there was a building a new building going up that was being built right outside across the street from our hotel and there in the building were photographers waiting for people to jump eleven people ended up dying in the fire five people jumped and died other people were killed by the smoke and there 's this loud thumping on the door after about 45 minutes in all this and people were shouting in korean and i remember natasha did n't want us opening the door [UNK] sorry i was trying not to open the door because we 'd spent so much time barricading the room i did n't know who it was i did n't know what they wanted and natasha could tell they were firemen trying to get us out i remember a sort of a tussle at the door trying to get the door open in any case 12 hours later i mean they put us in the lobby gene ended up using his coat and his fist in the coat to break open a liquor cabinet people were lying on the floor it was one of just the most horrifying nights and then 12 hours later we rented a car as we had planned to and drove back to natasha 's village and we kept saying " do you realize we were dying in a hotel fire like eight hours ago " it 's so weird how life just goes on natasha wanted to introduce her brother and father to all the villagers and the day we showed up turned out to be a 60-year-old man 's birthday this guy 's 60 years old so it turned into a dual celebration because natasha was the first person from this village ever to go to the united states so these are the greenhouse tents this is the elders teaching gene their dances we drank a lot of rice wine we were both so drunk i could n't believe it this is the last picture before gene and tim headed back the adoption people told us it was going to take a year for the adoption to go through like what could you do for a year so i found out the name of every official on both the korean and american side and i photographed them and told them how famous they were going to be when this book was done and four months later the adoption papers came through this is saying goodbye to everybody at the orphanage this is father keene with natasha at the bus stop her great aunt at the airport i had a wonderful deal with cathay pacific airlines for many years where they gave me free passes on all their airlines in return for photography it was like the ultimate perk and the pilot i actually knew [UNK] because they used to let me sit in the jump seat to tell you how long ago this was this is a tri-star and so they let natasha actually sit in the jump seat and the pilot jeff cowley actually went back and adopted one of the other kids at the orphanage after meeting natasha this is 28 hours later in atlanta it 's a very long flight just to make things even crazier gail natasha 's new mom was three days away from giving birth to her own daughter so you know if you were writing this you 'd say " no we 've got to write the script differently " this is the first night showing natasha her new cousins and uncles and aunts gene and gail know everyone in atlanta [UNK] they 're the most social couple imaginable so at this point natasha does n't speak a word of english other than what little father keene taught her this is kylie her sister who 's now a doctor on the right this is a deal i had with natasha which is that when we got to atlanta she could take [UNK] she could cut off my beard she never liked it very much she learned english in three months she entered seventh grade at her own age level pledge of allegiance for the first time this is her cooking teacher natasha told me that a lot of the kids thought she was stuck up because they would talk to her and she would n't answer and they did n't realize she did n't actually speak english very well in the beginning but what i noticed again as an observer was she was choosing who was going to be on her team and seemed to be very popular very very quickly now remember the picture how much she looked like her grandmother at the beginning people were always telling natasha how much she looks like her mother gail this is a tense moment in the first football game i think and kylie [UNK] i mean it was almost like kylie was her own child she 's being baptized now a lot of parents when they adopt actually want to erase their children 's history and gail and gene did the complete opposite they were studying korean they bought korean clothes gene even did a little tile work in the kitchen which was that " once upon a time there was a beautiful girl that came from hills of korea to live happily ever after in atlanta " she hates this picture [UNK] it was her first job she bought a bright red karmann ghia with the money she made working at burger king the captain of the cheerleaders beauty pageant used to do their christmas card every year gene 's been restoring this car for a million years kodak hired natasha to be a translator for them at the olympics in korea her future husband jeff was working for canon cameras and met natasha at the olympic village this is her first trip back to korea so there 's her uncle this is her half-sister she went back to the village that 's her best friend 's mother and i always thought that was a very annie hall kind of outfit it 's just you know it was just so interesting just to watch [UNK] this is her mother in the background there this is natasha 's wedding day gene is looking a little older this is sydney who 's going to be three years old in a couple of days and there 's evan natasha would you just come up for a second just maybe to say hello to everybody natasha 's actually never heard me tell the story i mean she [UNK] you know we 've looked at the pictures together natasha i 've seen pictures millions of times but today was the first time i 'm actually seeing him give the whole presentation i started crying rick smolan i 'm sure there 's about 40 things she 's going to tell me " that was n't what happened that was n't what you said " natasha later i 'll do that later rs anyway thank you mike and richard so much for letting us tell the story thank you all of you .this is your conference and i think you have a right to know a little bit right now in this transition period about this guy who 's going to be looking after it for you for a bit so i 'm just going to grab a chair here two years ago at ted i think [UNK] i 've come to this conclusion [UNK] i think i may have been suffering from a strange delusion i think that i may have believed unconsciously then that i was kind of a business hero i had this company that i 'd spent 15 years building it 's called future it was a magazine publishing company it had recently gone public and the market said that it was apparently worth two billion dollars a number i did n't really understand a magazine i 'd recently launched called business 2.0 was fatter than a telephone directory busy pumping hot air into the bubble and i was the 40 percent owner of a dotcom that was about to go public and no doubt be worth billions more and all this had come from nothing fifteen years earlier i was a science journalist who people just laughed at when i said " i really would like to start my own computer magazine " and 15 years later there are 100 of them and 2,000 people on staff and it was just such heady times the date was february 2000 i thought the little graph of my business life that kind of looked a bit like moore 's law [UNK] i mean it had to right i was in for quite a surprise the dotcom ironically called snowball was the very last consumer web company to go public the next month before nasdaq exploded and i entered 18 months of business hell i watched everything that i 'd built crumbling and it looked like all this stuff was going to die and 15 years work would have come for nothing and it was gut wrenching it took eight years of blood sweat and tears to reach 350 employees something which i was very proud of in the business february 2001 [UNK] in one day we laid off 350 people and before the bloodshed was finished 1,000 people had lost their jobs from my companies i felt sick i watched my own net worth falling by about a million dollars a day every day for 18 months and worse than that far worse than that my sense of self-worth was kind of evaporating i was going around with this big sign on my forehead " loser " and i think what disgusts me more than anything looking back is how the hell did i let my personal happiness get so tied up with this business thing well in the end we were able to save future and snowball but i was at that point ready to move on and to cut a long story short here 's where i came to and the reason i 'm telling this story is that i believe from many conversations that a lot of people in this room have been through a similar kind of rollercoaster [UNK] emotional rollercoaster [UNK] in the last couple years this has been a big big transition time and i believe that this conference can play a big part for all of us in taking us forward to the next stage to whatever 's next the theme next year is re-birth it was at the same ted two years ago when richard and i reached an agreement on the future of ted and at about the same time and i think partly because of that i started doing something that i 'd forgotten about in my business focus i started to read again and i discovered that while i 'd been busy playing business games there 'd been this incredible revolution in so many areas of interest cosmology to psychology to evolutionary psychology to anthropology to 1 all this stuff had changed and the way in which you could think about us as a species and us as a planet had just changed so much and it was incredibly exciting and what was really most exciting [UNK] and i think richard wurman discovered this at least 20 years before i did [UNK] was that all this stuff is connected it 's connected it all hooks into each other we talk about this a lot and i thought about trying to give an example of this so just one example madame de gaulle the wife of the french president was famously asked once " what do you most desire " and she answered " a penis " and when you think about it it 's very true what we all most desire is a penis [UNK] or " happiness " as we say in english and something 1 good luck with that one in the japanese translation room but something as basic as happiness which 20 years ago would have been just something for discussion in the church or mosque or synagogue today it turns out that there 's dozens of ted-like questions that you can ask about it which are really interesting you can ask about what causes it biochemically neuroscience serotonin all that stuff you can ask what are the psychological causes of it nature nurture current circumstance turns out that the research done on that is absolutely mind-blowing you can view it as a computing problem an artificial intelligence problem do you need to incorporate some sort of analog of happiness into a computer brain to make it work properly you can view it in sort of geopolitical terms and say why is it that a billion people on this planet are so desperately needy that they have no possibility of happiness and whereas almost all the rest of them regardless of how much money they have [UNK] whether it 's two dollars a day or whatever [UNK] are almost equally happy on average or you can view it as an evolutionary psychology kind of thing did our genes invent this as a kind of trick to get us to behave in certain ways the ant 's brain parasitized to make us behave in certain ways so that our genes would propagate are we the victims of a mass delusion and so on and so on to understand even something as important to us as happiness you kind of have to branch off in all these different directions and there 's nowhere that i 've discovered [UNK] other than ted [UNK] where you can ask that many questions in that many different directions and so it 's the profound thing that richard talks about to understand anything you just need to understand the little bits a little bit about everything that surrounds it and so gradually over these three days you start off kind of trying to figure out " why am i listening to all this irrelevant stuff " and at the end of the four days your brain is humming and you feel energized alive and excited and it 's because all these different bits have been put together it 's the total brain experience we 're going to 1 it 's the mental equivalent of the full body massage every mental organ addressed it really is enough of the theory chris tell us what you 're actually going to do all right so i will here 's the vision for ted number one do nothing this thing ai n't broke so i ai n't gon na fix it jeff bezos kindly remarked to me " chris ted is a really great conference you 're going to have to fuck up really badly to make it bad " so i gave myself the job title of ted custodian for a reason and i will promise you right here and now that the core values that make ted special are not going to be interfered with truth curiosity diversity no selling no corporate bullshit no bandwagoning no platforms just the pursuit of interest wherever it lies across all the disciplines that are represented here that 's not going to be changed at all number two i am going to put together an incredible line up of speakers for next year the time scale on which ted operates is just fantastic after coming out of a magazine business with monthly deadlines there 's a year to do this and already [UNK] i hope to show you a bit later [UNK] there 's 25 or so terrific speakers signed up for next year and i 'm getting fantastic help from the community this is just such a great community and combined our contacts reach pretty much everyone who 's interesting in the country if not the planet it 's true number three i do want to if i can find a way of extending the ted experience throughout the year a little bit and one key way that we 're going to do this is to introduce this book club books kind of saved me in the last couple years and that 's a gift that i would like to pass on so when you sign up for ted2003 every six weeks you 'll get a care package with a book or two and a reason why they 're linked to ted they may well be by a ted speaker and so we can get the conversation going during the year and come back next year having had the same intellectual emotional journey i think it will be great and then fourthly i want to mention the sapling foundation which is the new owner of ted what sapling 's ownership means is that all of the proceeds of ted will go towards the causes that sapling stands for and more important i think the ideas that are exhibited and realized here are ideas that the foundation can use because there 's fantastic synergy already just in the last few days we 've had so many people talking about stuff that they care about that they 're passionate about that can make a difference in the world and the idea of getting this group of people together [UNK] some of the causes that we believe in the money that this conference can raise and the ideas [UNK] i really believe that that combination will over time make a difference i 'm incredibly excited about that in fact i do n't think overall that i 've been as excited by anything ever in my life i 'm in this for the long run and i would be greatly honored and excited if you 'll come on this journey with me .i 'm a or was or kind of am a toy designer and before i was a toy designer oh i was a mime a street mime actually and then i was an entertainer i guess and before that i was a silversmith and before that i was [UNK] i was out of the house at about 15 and a half and i never wound up going into college i did n't really [UNK] i did n't see the point at the time i do now after learning about all the quantum stuff it 's really cool anyway i wanted to show you a little bit about the world of toy design at least from my small aperture of the world this is a video i made when i first started doing toy design i 'm in my garage making weird stuff and then you go to these toy companies and there 's some guy across the table and he goes " pass pass pass " you know you think it 's so cool but they [UNK] anyway i made this little tape that i 'd always show when i go in this is the name of my company giving toys so i used to work at mattel actually and after i left mattel i started all these hamburger makers and then got the license to make the maker so this is a hamburger maker that you take the peanut butter and stuff and you put it in there and it makes [UNK] and this is a french fry maker little tiny food you can eat i beat up the pasta maker to make that then this is a mcnugget maker i think this now that 's the mcnugget maker and this is a [UNK] this is my oldest daughter making a mcapple pie and let 's see you can make the pie and cinnamon and sugar and then you eat and you eat and you eat and you [UNK] she 's about 300 pounds now no she 's not she 's beautiful this is how they looked when they came out at the end these are a [UNK] this is like a 15 million dollar line and it got me through some [UNK] i did n't make any royalties on this but it got me through next is a compilation of a bunch of stuff that was a missile foam launcher that did n't get sold this is a squishy head for no apparent reason this is some effects that i did for " wig rattle and roll " that was a robot eye thing controlling it in the back that paid the rent for about a month this is a walking barbie [UNK] i said " oh this is it 1 " and they go " oh that 's really nice " and out it goes so this is some fighting robots i thought everyone would want these they fight they get back up you know would n't this be cool and they made it into a toy and then they dropped it like a hot rock they 're pretty cool this is a [UNK] we 're doing some flight-testing on my little pug seeing if this can really grab it does pretty good i 'm using little phone connectors to make them so they can spin it 's how they see have those album things [UNK] kids do n't know what they are this is a clay maker you know i said [UNK] i went to play-doh and said " look i can animate this " they said " do n't talk to us about play-doh " and then i made a lego animator i thought this would be so great 1 and you know lego [UNK] do n't take legos to lego that 's the answer they know everything about it then i started doing animatronics i loved dinosaurs i used to be in the film business kind of and actually nicholas negroponte saw this when i was like 12 and anyway so then they said " no you have to make two and they have to fight " you know how [UNK] why would a kid want a dinosaur this is me using [ unclear ] or 3-d studio back in the '80s that 's david letterman you can see how old this stuff is that 's my youngest cousin this is a segment called " dangerous toys you wo n't see at christmas " we had my first saw blade launcher and we had a flamethrower chair my career basically peaked here and in the back are foam-core cutouts of the people who could n't make it to the show this is mek going through a windshield wiper motor so this is a [UNK] i used to kind of be an actor and i 'm really not very good at it but the [UNK] this is a guy named dr. yatz who would take toys apart and show kids about engineering and you can see the massively parallel processing nintendos there and over to the left is a view master of the cd-rom and a guy named stan reznikov did this as a pilot this is a [UNK] you can see the little window there you can actually see the steadicam with a bubble on the bottom you see the keyboard strapped to my wrist way ahead of my time here narrator i love toys 1 caleb chung that 's all i wanted to say there i love toys ok so so that was a that was the first kind of a [UNK] that was the first batch of products most of them did not go you get one out of 20 one out of 30 products and every now and then we do something like a you know an automated hair wrap machine you know that tangles your hair and pulls your scalp out and [UNK] and we 'd make some money on that you know and we 'd give it out but eventually we left l.a. and we moved to idaho where there was actually a lot of peace and quiet and i started working on this project [UNK] oh i have to tell you about this real quick throughout this whole thing making toys i think there is a real correlation with innovation and art and science there 's some kind of a blend that happens that allows you know to find innovation and i tried to sum this up in some kind of symbol that means something to me anyway and so art and science have a kind of dynamic balance that 's where i think innovation happens and actually this is to me how i can come up with great ideas but it 's not how you actually get leverage actually you have to put a circle around that and call it business and those three together i think give you leverage in the world but moving on so this is a quick tale i 'm going to tell this is the furby tale as he said i was co-inventor of the furby i did the body and creature [UNK] well you 'll see so by way of showing you this you can kind of get an understanding of what it is to hopefully try to create robotic life forms or technology that has an emotional connection with the user so this is my family this is my wife christi and abby and melissa and my 17-year-old now emily who was just a pack of trouble all right there 's that robot again i came out of the movie business as i said and i said let 's make these animatronic robots let 's make these things and so i 've always had a big interest in this this one actually did n't go anywhere but i got my feet wet doing this this is a smaller one and i have a little moving torso on there a little tiny guy walks along more servo drives lots of servo hacking lots of mechanical stuff there 's another one he actually has skeletor legs i think he 's wearing there oh this is a little pony little pony [UNK] very cute little thing the point of showing these is i 've always been interested in little artificial life pieces so the challenge was [UNK] i worked for microsoft for a little bit working on the microsoft barney and this is a [UNK] you know the purple dinosaur with kind of bloat wear and you know they had lots just lots of stuff in there that you did n't need i thought and then microsoft can just fill a you know a warehouse full of this stuff and see if they sell so it 's a really strange business model compared to coming from a toy company but anyway a friend of mine and i dave hampton decided to see if we could do like a single-cell organism what 's the fewest pieces we could use to make a little life form and that 's our little thirty-cent mabuchi motor and so i have all these design books like i 'm sure many of you have and throughout the books [UNK] this is the first page on furby [UNK] i have kind of the art and science i have the why over here and the how over there i try to do a lot of philosophy a lot of thinking about all of these projects because they 're not just " bing " ideas you have to really dig deep in these things so there 's some real pseudo-code over here and getting the idea of different kind of drives things like that and originally furby only had two eyes and some batteries on the bottom and then we said well you 're going to feed him and he needs to talk and it got more complicated and then i had to figure out how i 'm going to use that one motor to make the eyes move and the ears move and the body to move and the mouth to move and you know i want to make it blink and do all that at the same time well i came up with this kind of linear expression thing with these cams and feedback and that worked pretty well then i started to get a little more realistic and i have to start drawing the stuff and there 's my " note to self " at the top " lots of engineering " so that turned out to be a little more than true there 's my first exploded view and all the little pieces and the little worm drive and all that stuff and then i 've got to start building it so this is the real thing i get up and start cutting my finger and gluing things together and that 's my little workshop and there 's the first little cam that drove furby and there 's furby on the half shell you can see the little bb in the box is my tilt sensor i just basically gnawed all this stuff out of plastic so there 's the back of his head with a billion holes in it and there i am i 'm done there 's my little furby no it 's a little robot on heroin or something i think so right now you see i love little robots so my wife says " well you may like it but nobody else will " so she comes to the rescue this is my wife christi who is just you know my muse and my partner for eternity here and she does drawings right she 's an actual you know artist and she starts doing all these different drawings and does color patterns and coloring books and i like the guy with the cigar at the bottom there he did n't test so well but i like him and then she started doing these other images at that time beanie babies was a big hit and we thought we 'll do a bunch of different ones so here 's a little pink one a little pouf on his head and here 's [UNK] this did n't do so well in testing either i do n't know why there 's my favorite demon furby that was a good one anyway finally settled on kind of this kind of a look little poufy body a little imaginary character and there he is a little bush baby on [UNK] caught in the headlights there i actually went to toys " r " us got a little furry cat ripped it apart and made this and since then every time i come home from toys " r " us with dolls or something they disappear from my desk and they get hidden in the house i have three girls and they just they [UNK] it 's like a rescue animal thing they 're going there so a little tether coming off it 's just a control for the fur 's mouth and his eyes it 's just a little server control and i made a little video going " hi my name 's furby and i 'm good " you know and then i 'd reach my hand he 'd [UNK] you can tickle him when i put my hand up " ha ha ha ha " and that 's how we sold him and hasbro actually said i meant tiger electronics at the time said " yeah we want to do this we have you know 13 weeks or something to toy fair and we 're going to hire you guys to do this " and so dave and i got working mostly me because it was all mechanics at this point so now i have to really figure out all kinds of stuff i do n't know how to do and i started working with solid works and a whole other group to do that and we started [UNK] this was way back before there was really much sla going on not a lot of rapid prototyping we certainly did n't have the money to do this they only paid me like a little bit of money to do this so i had to call a friend of a friend who was running the gm prototype plant sla plant that was down and they said " yeah well we 'll run them " so they ran all the shells for us which was nice of them and the cams i got cut at hewlett packard we snuck in on the weekend and so we just had a disc of the files but they have a closed system so you could n't print the things out on the machine so we actually printed them out on clear and taped them on the monitors and on the weekend we ran the parts for that so this is how they come out close to the end and then they looked like little garfields there eight months later [UNK] you may remember this this was a [UNK] total total total chaos for a while they were making two million furbys a month they actually wound up doing about 40 million furbys i [UNK] it 's unbelievable how [UNK] i do n't know how that can be and hasbro made about you know a billion and a half dollars and i just a little bit on each one so full circle [UNK] why do i do this why do you you know try to do this stuff and it 's of course for your kids and there 's my youngest daughter with her furbys and she still actually has those so i kind of retired and we 're already living in paradise up in boise on a river you know so and then i started another company called toy innovation and we did some projects with mattel with actually with a lady who 's here ivy ross and we did miracle moves baby made it in wired magazine did a bunch of other stuff and then i started another company we did a little hand-held device for teens that could hook up to the internet won " best innovations " at ces but really i kind of slowed down and said ok i just 1 after a while i had this old tape of this dinosaur and i gave it to this guy and this other guy saw it and then people started to want to do it and they said they 'd spend all this time so i said " ok let 's try to do this dinosaur project " the crazy idea is we 're going to try to clone a dinosaur as much as we can with today 's technology and it 's not really [UNK] but as close as we can do and we 're going to try to really pull this off intentfully try to make something that seems like it 's alive not a robot that kind of does but let 's really go for it so i picked a camarasaurus because the camarasaurus was the most abundant of the sauropods in north america and you could actually find full fossil evidence of these that 's a juvenile and so we actually went in there 's a book called " walking on eggshells " where they found actual sauropod skin in patagonia and the picture from the book so when i [UNK] i told the sculptor to use this bump pattern whatever you can to copy that very very obsessive there 's a kind of truncated camarasaurus skeleton but the geometry 's correct and then i went in and measured all the geometry because i figured hey biomimicry if i do it kind of right it might move kind of like the real thing so there 's the motor and about this time you know all these other people are starting to help here 's an example of what we did with the skull there 's the skull there 's my drawing of a skull there 's kind of the skin version of the soft tissue there 's the mechanism that would go in there kind of a geneva drive there 's some solid works versions of it here 's some sla parts of the same thing and then these are really crude pieces we were just doing some tests here there 's the skull pretty much the same shape as the camarasaurus there 's a photorealistic eye behind a lens and there 's kind of the first exploded view or see-through view there 's the first sla version and it already kind of has the feel it has kind of a cuteness already and the thing about blending science and art in this multidisciplinary stuff is you can do a robot and then you go back and do the shape and then you go back and forth the servos in the front legs we had to shape those like muscles they had to fit within the envelope there was a tremendous amount of work to get all that working right all the neck and the tail are cable so it moves smoothly and organically and then of course you 're not done yet you have to get the look for the skin the skin 's a whole another thing probably the hardest part so you hire artists and you try to get the look and feel of the character now this is not [UNK] we 're character designers right and we 're still trying to keep with the real character so now you go back and you cover the whole thing with clay now you start doing the sculpture for this and you can see we got a guy from [UNK] who 's just a fanatic about dinosaurs to do the sculpting for us down to the spoon-shaped teeth and everything and then more sculpting and then more sculpting and then more sculpting and then more sculpting and then four years and 10 million dollars later we have a little pleo john do you want to bring him up john sosoka is our cto and is really the man that 's done most of the work with our 40-person company i 'd like to give john a hand he never gets recognition this is john sosoka so thank you john thank you and get back to work all right man all right [UNK] [UNK] no it 's very painful so [UNK] [UNK] these are little pleos and you can probably see them this [UNK] i on purpose [UNK] they go through life stages so when you first get them they 're babies and you [UNK] more you have them kind of the older they get and they kind of learn through their behavior so this one this one 's actually asleep and [UNK] hang on pleo wake up pleo come on so this guy 's listening to my voice here but they have 40 sensors all over their body they have seven processors they have 14 motors they have [UNK] but you do n't care do you they 're just cute right that 's the idea that 's the idea so you see [UNK] hey come on hey did you feel that there 's something big and loud over here hey that 's good wake up wake up wake up yeah they 're like kids you know you yeah yeah okay he 's hungry i 'll show you what he 's been doing for for four years here here here have some money pleo there you go that 's what the investors think that it 's just [UNK] [UNK] right right so they 're really sweet little guys and we 're hoping that [UNK] you know our belief is that humans need to feel empathy towards things in order to be more human and we think we can help that out by having little creatures that you can love now these are not robots they 're kind of lovebots you know they do change over time but mostly they evoke a feeling of caring and we have a [UNK] i have a little something here now i do want to say that you know ugobe is not there yet we 've just opened the door and it 's for all of you to step through it we did include some things that are hopefully useful excuse me pleo they [UNK] he has a usb and he has a sd card so it 's completely open architecture so anyone can plug him [UNK] [UNK] thank you this is john over here anyone can take pleo and they can totally redo his personality you can make him bipolar or as someone said a [UNK] [UNK] you can change his homeostatic drives or whatever you want to call them kids can just drag and drop put in new sounds we [UNK] actually it 's very hard to keep people from doing this we have one animator who 's taken it and he 's done a take on the budweiser beer commercial and they 're going " whassup " you know you [UNK] so it 's [UNK] yes he likes that so they 're a handful we hope you get one i do n't know what i 'm missing to say but as a last thing i 'd like to say is that if we continue along this path we are designing our children 's best friends and there 's a lot of social responsibility in that that 's why pleo 's soft and gentle and loving and so i just [UNK] i hope we all dream well thank you .i think i 'll start out and just talk a little bit about what exactly autism is autism is a very big continuum that goes from very severe [UNK] the child remains non-verbal [UNK] all the way up to brilliant scientists and engineers and i actually feel at home here because there 's a lot of autism genetics here you would n't have any 1 it 's a continuum of traits when does a nerd turn into asperger which is just mild autism i mean einstein and mozart and tesla would all be probably diagnosed as autistic spectrum today and one of the things that is really going to concern me is getting these kids to be the ones that are going to invent the next energy things you know that bill gates talked about this morning ok. now if you want to understand autism animals and i want to talk to you now about different ways of thinking you have to get away from verbal language i think in pictures i do n't think in language now the thing about the autistic mind is it attends to details ok this is a test where you either have to pick out the big letters or pick out the little letters and the autistic mind picks out the little letters more quickly and the thing is the normal brain ignores the details well if you 're building a bridge details are pretty important because it will fall down if you ignore the details and one of my big concerns with a lot of policy things today is things are getting too abstract people are getting away from doing hands-on stuff i 'm really concerned that a lot of the schools have taken out the hands-on classes because art and classes like that those are the classes where i excelled in my work with cattle i noticed a lot of little things that most people do n't notice would make the cattle balk like for example this flag waving right in front of the veterinary facility this feed yard was going to tear down their whole veterinary facility all they needed to do was move the flag rapid movement contrast in the early '70s when i started i got right down in the chutes to see what cattle were seeing people thought that was crazy a coat on a fence would make them balk shadows would make them balk a hose on the floor 1 people were n't noticing these things [UNK] a chain hanging down [UNK] and that 's shown very very nicely in the movie in fact i loved the movie how they duplicated all my projects that 's the geek side my drawings got to star in the movie too and actually it 's called " temple grandin " not " thinking in pictures " so what is thinking in pictures it 's literally movies in your head my mind works like google for images now when i was a young kid i did n't know my thinking was different i thought everybody thought in pictures and then when i did my book " thinking in pictures " i start interviewing people about how they think and i was shocked to find out that my thinking was quite different like if i say " think about a church steeple " most people get this sort of generalized generic one now maybe that 's not true in this room but it 's going to be true in a lot of different places i see only specific pictures they flash up into my memory just like google for pictures and in the movie they 've got a great scene in there where the word " shoe " is said and a whole bunch of '50s and '60s shoes pop into my imagination ok there is my childhood church that 's specific there 's some more fort collins ok how about famous ones and they just kind of come up kind of like this just really quickly like google for pictures and they come up one at a time and then i think " ok well maybe we can have it snow or we can have a thunderstorm " and i can hold it there and turn them into videos now visual thinking was a tremendous asset in my work designing cattle-handling facilities and i 've worked really hard on improving how cattle are treated at the slaughter plant i 'm not going to go into any gucky slaughter slides i 've got that stuff up on youtube if you want to look at it but one of the things that i was able to do in my design work is i could actually test run a piece of equipment in my mind just like a virtual reality computer system and this is an aerial view of a recreation of one of my projects that was used in the movie that was like just so super cool and autism types working out there on the movie set too but one of the things that really worries me is where 's the younger version of those kids going today they 're not ending up in silicon valley where they belong now one of the things i learned very early on because i was n't that social is i had to sell my work and not myself and the way i sold livestock jobs is i showed off my drawings i showed off pictures of things another thing that helped me as a little kid is boy in the '50s you were taught manners you were taught you ca n't pull the merchandise off the shelves in the store and throw it around now when kids get to be in third or fourth grade you might see that this kid 's going to be a visual thinker drawing in perspective now i want to emphasize that not every autistic kid is going to be a visual thinker now i had this brain scan done several years ago and i used to joke around about having a gigantic internet trunk line going deep into my visual cortex this is tensor imaging and my great big internet trunk line is twice as big as the control 's the red lines there are me and the blue lines are the sex and age-matched control and there i got a gigantic one and the control over there the blue one has got a really small one and some of the research now is showing is that people on the spectrum actually think with primary visual cortex now the thing is the visual thinker 's just one kind of mind you see the autistic mind tends to be a specialist mind [UNK] good at one thing bad at something else and where i was bad was algebra and i was never allowed to take geometry or trig gigantic mistake i 'm finding a lot of kids who need to skip algebra go right to geometry and trig now another kind of mind is the pattern thinker more abstract these are your engineers your computer programmers now this is pattern thinking that praying mantis is made from a single sheet of paper [UNK] no scotch tape no cuts and there in the background is the pattern for folding it here are the types of thinking photo-realistic visual thinkers like me pattern thinkers music and math minds some of these oftentimes have problems with reading you also will see these kind of problems with kids that are dyslexic you 'll see these different kinds of minds and then there 's a verbal mind they know every fact about everything now another thing is the sensory issues i was really concerned about having to wear this gadget on my face and i came in half an hour beforehand so i could have it put on and kind of get used to it and they got it bent so it 's not hitting my chin but sensory is an issue some kids are bothered by fluorescent lights others have problems with sound sensitivity you know it 's going to be variable now visual thinking gave me a whole lot of insight into the animal mind because think about it an animal is a sensory-based thinker not verbal [UNK] thinks in pictures thinks in sounds thinks in smells think about how much information there is there on the local fire hydrant he knows who 's been there when they were there are they friend or foe is there anybody he can go mate with there 's a ton of information on that fire hydrant it 's all very detailed information and looking at these kind of details gave me a lot of insight into animals now the animal mind and also my mind puts sensory-based information into categories man on a horse and a man on the ground [UNK] that is viewed as two totally different things you could have a horse that 's been abused by a rider they 'll be absolutely fine with the veterinarian and with the horseshoer but you ca n't ride him you have another horse where maybe the horseshoer beat him up and he 'll be terrible for anything on the ground with the veterinarian but a person can ride him cattle are the same way man on a horse a man on foot [UNK] they 're two different things you see it 's a different picture see i want you to think about just how specific this is now this ability to put information into categories i find a lot of people are not very good at this when i 'm out troubleshooting equipment or problems with something in a plant they do n't seem to be able to figure out " do i have a training people issue or do i have something wrong with the equipment " in other words categorize equipment problem from a people problem i find a lot of people have difficulty doing that now let 's say i figure out it 's an equipment problem is it a minor problem with something simple i can fix or is the whole design of the system wrong people have a hard time figuring that out let 's just look at something like you know solving problems with making airlines safer yeah i 'm a million-mile flyer i do lots and lots of flying and if i was at the faa what would i be doing a lot of direct observation of it would be their airplane tails you know five fatal wrecks in the last 20 years the tail either came off or steering stuff inside the tail broke in some way it 's tails pure and simple and when the pilots walk around the plane guess what they ca n't see that stuff inside the tail you know now as i think about that i 'm pulling up all of that specific information it 's specific see my thinking 's bottom-up i take all the little pieces and i put the pieces together like a puzzle now here is a horse that was deathly afraid of black cowboy hats he 'd been abused by somebody with a black cowboy hat white cowboy hats that was absolutely fine now the thing is the world is going to need all of the different kinds of minds to work together we 've got to work on developing all these different kinds of minds and one of the things that is driving me really crazy as i travel around and i do autism meetings is i 'm seeing a lot of smart geeky nerdy kids and they just are n't very social and nobody 's working on developing their interest in something like science and this brings up the whole thing of my science teacher my science teacher is shown absolutely beautifully in the movie i was a goofball student when i was in high school i just did n't care at all about studying until i had mr. carlock 's science class he was now dr. carlock in the movie and he got me challenged to figure out an optical illusion room this brings up the whole thing of you 've got to show kids interesting stuff you know one of the things that i think maybe ted ought to do is tell all the schools about all the great lectures that are on ted and there 's all kinds of great stuff on the internet to get these kids turned on because i 'm seeing a lot of these geeky nerdy kids and the teachers out in the midwest and the other parts of the country when you get away from these tech areas they do n't know what to do with these kids and they 're not going down the right path the thing is you can make a mind to be more of a thinking and cognitive mind or your mind can be wired to be more social and what some of the research now has shown in autism is there may by extra wiring back here in the really brilliant mind and we lose a few social circuits here it 's kind of a trade-off between thinking and social and then you can get into the point where it 's so severe you 're going to have a person that 's going to be non-verbal in the normal human mind language covers up the visual thinking we share with animals this is the work of dr. bruce miller and he studied alzheimer 's patients that had frontal temporal lobe dementia and the dementia ate out the language parts of the brain and then this artwork came out of somebody who used to install stereos in cars now van gogh does n't know anything about physics but i think it 's very interesting that there was some work done to show that this eddy pattern in this painting followed a statistical model of turbulence which brings up the whole interesting idea of maybe some of this mathematical patterns is in our own head and the wolfram stuff [UNK] i was taking notes and i was writing down all the search words i could use because i think that 's going to go on in my autism lectures we 've got to show these kids interesting stuff and they 've taken out the autoshop class and the drafting class and the art class i mean art was my best subject in school we 've got to think about all these different kinds of minds and we 've got to absolutely work with these kind of minds because we absolutely are going to need these kind of people in the future and let 's talk about jobs ok my science teacher got me studying because i was a goofball that did n't want to study but you know what i was getting work experience i 'm seeing too many of these smart kids who have n't learned basic things like how to be on time i was taught that when i was eight years old you know how to have table manners at granny 's sunday party i was taught that when i was very very young and when i was 13 i had a job at a dressmaker 's shop sewing clothes i did internships in college i was building things and i also had to learn how to do assignments you know all i wanted to do was draw pictures of horses when i was little my mother said " well let 's do a picture of something else " they 've got to learn how to do something else let 's say the kid is fixated on legos let 's get him working on building different things the thing about the autistic mind is it tends to be fixated like if a kid loves racecars let 's use racecars for math let 's figure out how long it takes a racecar to go a certain distance in other words use that fixation in order to motivate that kid that 's one of the things we need to do i really get fed up when they you know the teachers especially when you get away from this part of the country they do n't know what to do with these smart kids it just drives me crazy what can visual thinkers do when they grow up they can do graphic design all kinds of stuff with computers photography industrial design the pattern thinkers they 're the ones that are going to be your mathematicians your software engineers your computer programmers all of those kinds of jobs and then you 've got the word minds they make great journalists and they also make really really good stage actors because the thing about being autistic is i had to learn social skills like being in a play it 's just kind of [UNK] you just have to learn it and we need to be working with these students and this brings up mentors you know my science teacher was not an accredited teacher he was a nasa space scientist now some states now are getting it to where if you have a degree in biology or a degree in chemistry you can come into the school and teach biology or chemistry we need to be doing that because what i 'm observing is the good teachers for a lot of these kids are out in the community colleges but we need to be getting some of these good teachers into the high schools another thing that can be very very very successful is there is a lot of people that may have retired from working in the software industry and they can teach your kid and it does n't matter if what they teach them is old because what you 're doing is you 're lighting the spark you 're getting that kid turned on and you get him turned on then he 'll learn all the new stuff mentors are just essential i can not emphasize enough what my science teacher did for me and we 've got to mentor them hire them and if you bring them in for internships in your companies the thing about the autism asperger-y kind of mind you 've got to give them a specific task do n't just say " design new software " you 've got to tell them something a lot more specific " well we 're designing a software for a phone and it has to do some specific thing and it can only use so much memory " that 's the kind of specificity you need well that 's the end of my talk and i just want to thank everybody for coming it was great to be here oh you 've got a question for me ok chris anderson thank you so much for that you know you once wrote i like this quote " if by some magic autism had been eradicated from the face of the earth then men would still be socializing in front of a wood fire at the entrance to a cave " temple grandin because who do you think made the first stone spears the asperger guy and if you were to get rid of all the autism genetics there would be no more silicon valley and the energy crisis would not be solved ca so i want to ask you a couple other questions and if any of these feel inappropriate it 's okay just to say " next question " but if there is someone here who has an autistic child or knows an autistic child and feels kind of cut off from them what advice would you give them tg well first of all you 've got to look at age if you have a two three or four year old you know no speech no social interaction i ca n't emphasize enough do n't wait you need at least 20 hours a week of one-to-one teaching you know the thing is autism comes in different degrees there 's going to be about half the people on the spectrum that are not going to learn to talk and they 're not going to be working silicon valley that would not be a reasonable thing for them to do but then you get the smart geeky kids that have a touch of autism and that 's where you 've got to get them turned on with doing interesting things i got social interaction through shared interest i rode horses with other kids i made model rockets with other kids did electronics lab with other kids and in the '60s it was gluing mirrors onto a rubber membrane on a speaker to make a light show that was like we considered that super cool ca is it unrealistic for them to hope or think that that child loves them as some might as most wish tg well let me tell you that child will be loyal and if your house is burning down they 're going to get you out of it ca wow so most people if you ask them what are they most passionate about they 'd say things like " my kids " or " my lover " what are you most passionate about tg i 'm passionate about that the things i do are going to make the world a better place when i have a mother of an autistic child say " my kid went to college because of your book or one of your lectures " that makes me happy you know the slaughter plants i 've worked with them in the '80s they were absolutely awful i developed a really simple scoring system for slaughter plants where you just measure outcomes how many cattle fell down how many cattle got poked with the prodder how many cattle are mooing their heads off and it 's very very simple you directly observe a few simple things it 's worked really well i get satisfaction out of seeing stuff that makes real change in the real world we need a lot more of that and a lot less abstract stuff ca when we were talking on the phone one of the things you said that really astonished me was you said one thing you were passionate about was server farms tell me about that tg well the reason why i got really excited when i read about that it contains knowledge it 's libraries and to me knowledge is something that is extremely valuable so maybe over 10 years ago now our library got flooded and this is before the internet got really big and i was really upset about all the books being wrecked because it was knowledge being destroyed and server farms or data centers are great libraries of knowledge ca temple can i just say it 's an absolute delight to have you at ted tg well thank you so much thank you .you should be nice to nerds in fact i 'd go so far as to say if you do n't already have a nerd in your life you should get one i 'm just saying scientists and engineers change the world i 'd like to tell you about a magical place called darpa where scientists and engineers defy the impossible and refuse to fear failure now these two ideas are connected more than you may realize because when you remove the fear of failure impossible things suddenly become possible if you want to know how ask yourself this question what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail if you really ask yourself this question you ca n't help but feel uncomfortable i feel a little uncomfortable because when you ask it you begin to understand how the fear of failure constrains you how it keeps us from attempting great things and life gets dull amazing things stop happening sure good things happen but amazing things stop happening now i should be clear i 'm not encouraging failure i 'm discouraging fear of failure because it 's not failure itself that constrains us the path to truly new never-been-done-before things always has failure along the way we 're tested and in part that testing feels an appropriate part of achieving something great clemenceau said " life gets interesting when we fail because it 's a sign that we 've surpassed ourselves " in 1895 lord kelvin declared that heavier-than-air flying machines were impossible in october of 1903 the prevailing opinion of expert aerodynamicists was that maybe in 10 million years we could build an aircraft that would fly and two months later on december 17th orville wright powered the first airplane across a beach in north carolina the flight lasted 12 seconds and covered 120 feet that was 1903 one year later the next declarations of impossibilities began ferdinand foch a french army general credited with having one of the most original and subtle minds in the french army said " airplanes are interesting toys but of no military value " 40 years later aero experts coined the term transonic they debated should it have one s or two you see they were having trouble in this flight regime and it was n't at all clear that we could fly faster than the speed of sound in 1947 there was no wind tunnel data beyond mach 0.85 and yet on tuesday october 14th 1947 chuck yeager climbed into the cockpit of his bell x-1 and he flew towards an unknown possibility and in so doing he became the first pilot to fly faster than the speed of sound six of eight atlas rockets blew up on the pad after 11 complete mission failures we got our first images from space and on that first flight we got more data than in all u-2 missions combined it took a lot of failures to get there since we took to the sky we have wanted to fly faster and farther and to do so we 've had to believe in impossible things and we 've had to refuse to fear failure that 's still true today today we do n't talk about flying transonically or even supersonically we talk about flying hypersonically [UNK] not mach 2 or mach 3 mach 20 at mach 20 we can fly from new york to long beach in 11 minutes and 20 seconds at that speed the surface of the airfoil is the temperature of molten steel [UNK] 3,500 degrees fahrenheit [UNK] like a blast furnace we are essentially burning the airfoil as we fly it and we are flying it or trying to darpa 's hypersonic test vehicle is the fastest maneuvering aircraft ever built it 's boosted to near-space atop a minotaur iv rocket now the minotaur iv has too much impulse so we have to bleed it off by flying the rocket at an 89 degree angle of attack for portions of the trajectory that 's an unnatural act for a rocket the third stage has a camera we call it rocketcam and it 's pointed at the hypersonic glider this is the actual rocketcam footage from flight one now to conceal the shape we changed the aspect ratio a little bit but this is what it looks like from the third stage of the rocket looking at the unmanned glider as it heads into the atmosphere back towards earth we 've flown twice in the first flight no aerodynamic control of the vehicle but we collected more hypersonic flight data than in 30 years of ground-based testing combined and in the second flight three minutes of fully-controlled aerodynamic flight at mach 20 we must fly again because amazing never-been-done-before things require that you fly you ca n't learn to fly at mach 20 unless you fly and while there 's no substitute for speed maneuverability is a very close second if a mach 20 glider takes 11 minutes and 20 seconds to get from new york to long beach a hummingbird would take well days you see hummingbirds are not hypersonic but they are maneuverable in fact the hummingbird is the only bird that can fly backwards it can fly up down forwards backwards even upside-down and so if we wanted to fly in this room or places where humans ca n't go we 'd need an aircraft small enough and maneuverable enough to do so this is a hummingbird drone it can fly in all directions even backwards it can hover and rotate this prototype aircraft is equipped with a video camera it weighs less than one aa battery it does not eat nectar in 2008 it flew for a whopping 20 seconds a year later two minutes then six eventually 11 many prototypes crashed [UNK] many but there 's no way to learn to fly like a hummingbird unless you fly it 's beautiful is n't it wow it 's great matt is the first ever hummingbird pilot failure is part of creating new and amazing things we can not both fear failure and make amazing new things [UNK] like a robot with the stability of a dog on rough terrain or maybe even ice a robot that can run like a cheetah or climb stairs like a human with the occasional clumsiness of a human or perhaps spider man will one day be gecko man a gecko can support its entire body weight with one toe one square millimeter of a gecko 's footpad has 14,000 hair-like structures called setae they are used to help it grip to surfaces using intermolecular forces today we can manufacture structures that mimic the hairs of a gecko 's foot the result a four-by-four-inch can support a static load of 660 pounds that 's enough to stick six 42-inch plasma tv 's to your wall no nails so much for velcro right and it 's not just passive structures it 's entire machines this is a spider mite it 's one millimeter long but it looks like godzilla next to these micromachines in the world of godzilla spider mites we can make millions of mirrors each one-fifth the diameter of a human hair moving at hundreds of thousands of times per second to make large screen displays so that we can watch movies like " godzilla " in high-def and if we can build machines at that scale what about eiffel tower-like trusses at the microscale today we are making metals that are lighter than styrofoam so light they can sit atop a dandelion puff and be blown away with a wisp of air [UNK] so light that you can make a car that two people can lift but so strong that it has the crash-worthiness of an suv from the smallest wisp of air to the powerful forces of nature 's storms there are 44 lightning strikes per second around the globe each lightning bolt heats the air to 44,000 degrees fahrenheit [UNK] hotter than the surface of the sun what if we could use these electromagnetic pulses as beacons beacons in a moving network of powerful transmitters experiments suggest that lightning could be the next gps electrical pulses form the thoughts in our brains using a grid the size of your thumb with 32 electrodes on the surface of his brain tim uses his thoughts to control an advanced prosthetic arm and his thoughts made him reach for katie this is the first time a human has controlled a robot with thought alone and it is the first time that tim has held katie 's hand in seven years that moment mattered to tim and katie and this green goo may someday matter to you this green goo is perhaps the vaccine that could save your life it was made in tobacco plants tobacco plants can make millions of doses of vaccine in weeks instead of months and it might just be the first healthy use of tobacco ever and if it seems far-fetched that tobacco plants could make people healthy what about gamers that could solve problems that experts ca n't solve last september the gamers of foldit solved the three-dimensional structure of the retroviral protease that contributes to aids in rhesus monkeys now understanding this structure is very important for developing treatments for 15 years it was unsolved in the scientific community the gamers of foldit solved it in 15 days now they were able to do so by working together they were able to work together because they 're connected by the internet and others also connected to the internet used it as an instrument of democracy and together they changed the fate of their nation the internet is home to two billion people or 30 percent of the world 's population it allows us to contribute and to be heard as individuals it allows us to amplify our voices and our power as a group but it too had humble beginnings in 1969 the internet was but a dream a few sketches on a piece of paper and then on october 29th the first packet-switched message was sent from ucla to sri the first two letters of the word " login " that 's all that made it through [UNK] an l and an o [UNK] and then a buffer overflow crashed the system two letters an l and an o now a worldwide force so who are these scientists and engineers at a magical place called darpa they are nerds and they are heroes among us they challenge existing perspectives at the edges of science and under the most demanding of conditions they remind us that we can change the world if we defy the impossible and we refuse to fear failure they remind us that we all have nerd power sometimes we just forget you see there was a time when you were n't afraid of failure when you were a great artist or a great dancer and you could sing you were good at math you could build things you were an astronaut an adventurer jacques cousteau you could jump higher run faster kick harder than anyone you believed in impossible things and you were fearless you were totally and completely in touch with your inner superhero scientists and engineers can indeed change the world so can you you were born to so go ahead ask yourself what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail now i want to say this is not easy it 's hard to hold onto this feeling really hard i guess in some way i sort of believe it 's supposed to be hard doubt and fear always creep in we think someone else someone smarter than us someone more capable someone with more resources will solve that problem but there is n't anyone else there 's just you and if we 're lucky in that moment someone steps into that doubt and fear takes a hand and says " let me help you believe " jason harley did that for me jason started at darpa on march 18th 2010 he was with our transportation team i saw jason nearly every day sometimes twice a day and more so than most he saw the highs and the lows the celebrations and the disappointments and on one particularly dark day for me jason sat down and he wrote an email he was encouraging but firm and when he hit send he probably did n't realize what a difference it would make it mattered to me in that moment and still today when i doubt when i feel afraid when i need to reconnect with that feeling i remember his words they were so powerful text " there is only time enough to iron your cape and back to the skies for you " superhero superhero superhero superhero superhero superhero superhero superhero superhero superhero voice because that 's what being a superhero is all about rd " there is only time enough to iron your cape and back to the skies for you " and remember be nice to nerds thank you thank you chris anderson regina thank you i have a couple of questions so that glider of yours the mach 20 glider the first one no control it ended up in the pacific i think somewhere rd yeah yeah it did yeah it also went into the pacific we did n't fly it into the pacific no there are multiple portions of the trajectory that are demanding in terms of really flying at that speed and so in the second flight we were able to get three minutes of fully aerodynamic control of the vehicle before we lost it ca i imagine you 're not planning to open up to passenger service from new york to long beach anytime soon rd it might be a little warm ca what do you picture that glider being used for rd well our responsibility is to develop the technology for this how it 's ultimately used will be determined by the military now the purpose of the vehicle though the purpose of the technology is to be able to reach anywhere in the world in less than 60 minutes ca and to carry a payload of more than a few pounds like what 's the payload it could carry rd well i do n't think we ultimately know what it will be right we 've got to fly it first ca but not necessarily just a camera rd no not necessarily just a camera ca it 's amazing the hummingbird rd yeah ca i 'm curious you started your beautiful sequence on flight with a plane kind of trying to flap its wings and failing horribly and there have n't been that many planes built since that flap wings why did we think that this was the time to go biomimicry and copy a hummingbird is n't that a very expensive solution for a small maneuverable flying object rd so i mean in part we wondered if it was possible to do it and you have to revisit these questions over time the folks at aerovironment tried 300 or more different wing designs 12 different forms of the avionics it took them 10 full prototypes to get something that would actually fly but there 's something really interesting about a flying machine that looks like something you 'd recognize so we often talk about stealth as a means for avoiding any type of sensing but when things looks just natural you also do n't see them ca ah so it 's not necessarily just the performance it 's partly the look it 's actually " look at that cute hummingbird flying into my headquarters " because i think as well as the awe of looking at that i 'm sure some people here are thinking technology catches up so quick how long is it before some crazed geek with a little remote control flies one through a window of the white house i mean do you worry about the pandora 's box issue here rd well look our singular mission is the creation and prevention of strategic surprise that 's what we do it would be inconceivable for us to do that work if we did n't make people excited and uncomfortable with the things that we do at the same time it 's just the nature of what we do now our responsibility is to push that edge and we have to be of course mindful and responsible of how the technology is developed and ultimately used but we ca n't simply close our eyes and pretend that it is n't advancing it 's advancing ca i mean you 're clearly a really inspiring leader and you persuade people to go to these great feats of invention but at a personal level in a way i ca n't imagine doing your job do you wake up in the night sometimes just asking questions about the possibly unintended consequences of your team 's brilliance rd sure i think you could n't be human if you did n't ask those questions ca how do you answer them rd well i do n't always have answers for them right i think that we learn as time goes on my job is one of the most exhilarating jobs you could have i work with some of the most amazing people and with that exhilaration comes a really deep sense of responsibility and so you have on the one hand this tremendous lift of what 's possible and this tremendous seriousness of what it means ca regina that was jaw-dropping as they say thank you so much for coming to ted .there are more chinese restaurants in this country than mcdonald 's burger king kentucky fried chicken and wendy 's combined [UNK] 40,000 actually chinese restaurants have played an important role in american history as a matter of fact the cuban missile crisis was resolved in a chinese restaurant called yenching palace in washington d.c. which unfortunately is closed now and about to be turned into walgreen 's and the house that john wilkes booth planned the assassination of abraham lincoln is actually also now a chinese restaurant called wok 'n roll on h street in washington and it 's not completely gratuitous because wok and roll [UNK] chinese food and japanese foods so it kind of works out and americans love their chinese food so much they 've actually brought it into space nasa for example serves thermal-stabilized sweet-and-sour pork on its shuttle menu for its astronauts so let me present the question to you if our benchmark for americanness is apple pie you should ask yourself how often do you eat apple pie versus how often do you eat chinese food right and if you think about it a lot of the foods that you think of or we think of or americans think of as chinese food are barely recognizable to chinese for example beef with broccoli egg rolls general tso 's chicken fortune cookies chop suey the take-out boxes for example i took a whole bunch of fortune cookies back to china gave them to chinese to see how they would react what is this should i try it try it 1 what is it called fortune cookie there 's a piece of paper inside 1 what is this you 've won a prize 1 what is this it 's a fortune 1 tasty 1 so where are they from the short answer is actually they 're from japan and in kyoto outside there are still small family-run bakeries that make fortune cookies as they did over 100 years ago 30 years before fortune cookies were introduced in the united states if you see them side by side there 's yellow and brown theirs are actually flavored with miso and sesame paste so they 're not as sweet as our version so how did they get to the united states well the short answer is the japanese immigrants came over and a bunch of the bakers introduced them [UNK] including at least one in los angeles and one here in san francisco called benkyo-do which is on the corner of sutter and buchanan they back then actually made fortune cookies using very much the similar kind of irons that we saw back in kyoto so the interesting question is how do you go from fortune cookies being something that is japanese to being something that is chinese well the short answer is we locked up all the japanese during world war ii including those that made fortune cookies so that 's the time when the chinese moved in kind of saw a market opportunity and took over so fortune cookies invented by the japanese popularized by the chinese but ultimately consumed by americans they are more american than anything else another one of my favorite dishes general tso 's chicken [UNK] which by the way in the us naval academy is called admiral tso 's chicken i love this dish the original name in my book was actually called the long march of general tso and he has marched very far indeed because he is sweet he is fried and he is chicken [UNK] all things that americans love he has marched so far actually that the chef who originally invented the dish does n't recognize it he 's kind of horrified he 's in taiwan right now he 's retired deaf and plays a lot of mahjong so he [UNK] after this i showed him he got up and he 's like " mominqimiao " which means " this is all nonsense " and goes back to play his mahjong game during the afternoon so another dish one of my favorites beef with broccoli broccoli is not a chinese vegetable in fact it is originally an italian vegetable it was introduced into the united states in the 1800s but became popularized in the 1920s and the 1930s in fact the chinese had their own version of broccoli which is called chinese broccoli but right now what [UNK] they 've now discovered american broccoli and are importing it as a sort of exotic delicacy i guarantee you general tso never saw a stalk of broccoli in his life [UNK] and indeed that actually was a picture of general tso i went to his home town this is a billboard that says " welcome to the birthplace of general tso " and i went looking for chicken finally found a cow [UNK] and did find chicken believe it or not these guys were actually crossing the road and [UNK] [UNK] i actually found a whole bunch of general tso 's relatives who are still in the little town this guy is now five generations removed from the general this guy is about seven showed them all the pictures of general tso chicken that i showed you and they 're like we do n't know this dish and then they 're like is this chinese food because it does n't look like chinese food to them but they were n't kind of surprised i traveled around the world to visit them because in their eyes he is after all a famous qing dynasty military hero he played an important role in the taiping rebellion which was a war started by a guy who thought he was the son of god and the baby brother of jesus christ and caused the war that killed 20 million people [UNK] still the deadliest civil war in the world to this day so you know i realized when i was there general tso is kind of a lot like colonel sanders in america in that he 's known for chicken and not war but in china this guy 's actually known for war and not chicken but the granddaddy of all the chinese-american dishes we probably ought to talk about is chop suey which was introduced around the turn of the 20th century and according to new york times in 1904 there was an outbreak of chinese restaurants all over town and " the city has gone 'chop suey ' mad " so it took about 30 years before the americans realized that whoa chop suey is actually not known in china and as this article points out " the average native of any city in china knows nothing of chop suey " you know back then it was a way to show that you were sophisticated and cosmopolitan if you were a guy and you wanted to impress a girl you could take her out on a chop suey date i like to say chop suey 's the biggest culinary joke that one culture has ever played on another because chop suey if you translate into chinese means tsap sui which if you translate back means " odds and ends " so these people are going around china asking for chop suey which is sort of like a japanese guy coming here and saying i understand you have a very popular dish in your country called " leftovers " and it is particularly [UNK] [UNK] right and not only that this dish is particularly popular after that holiday you call thanksgiving so why [UNK] why and where [UNK] did chop suey come from let 's go back to mid-1800s when the chinese first came to america now back then the americans were not clamoring to eat chinese food in fact they saw this people who landed at their shores as alien these people were n't eating dogs [UNK] they were eating cats [UNK] and they were n't eating cats [UNK] they were eating rats in fact the new york times my esteemed employer in 1883 ran an article that asked " do chinese eat rats " and not the most pc question to be asked today but if you kind of look at the popular imagery of the time not so outlandish this is actually a real advertisement for rat poison from the late 1800s and if you see under the word " clears " [UNK] very small [UNK] it says " they must go " which refers not only to the rats but to the chinese in their midst because the way that the food was perceived was that these people who ate foods different from us must be different from us and another way that you saw sort of this sort of this antipathy towards the chinese is through documents like this this is actually in the library of congress it is a pamphlet published by samuel gompers hero of our american labor movement and it 's called " some reason for chinese exclusion meat versus rice american manhood against asiatic coolieism which shall survive and it basically made the argument that chinese men who ate rice would necessarily bring down the standard of living for american men who ate meat this is one of the reasons why we must exclude them from this country so with sentiments like these the chinese exclusion act was sort of passed between 1882 and 1902 the only time in american history when a group was specifically excluded for its national origin or ethnicity so in a way because the chinese were attacked chop suey was created as a defense mechanism now who came up with the idea of chop suey there 's a lot of different mysteries a lot of different legends but of the ones that i 've found that i thought was most interesting is this article from 1904 a chinese guy named lem sen shows up in chinatown new york city and says i want you guys all to stop making chop suey because i am the original creator and sole proprietor of the dish known as chop suey and the way that he tells it there was a guy there was a famous chinese diplomat that showed up and he was told to make a dish that looked very popular and could quote " pass " as chinese and as he said [UNK] we would never print this today [UNK] but basically the american man has become very rich lem sen who 's this guy i would have made this money too but i 've spent all this time looking for the american man who stole my recipe now i 've come and found him and i want my recipe back and i want everyone to stop making chop suey or pay me for the right to do the same so it was an early exercise of intellectual property rights so the thing is this kind of idea of chinese-american food does n't exist only in america in fact if you think about it chinese food is the most pervasive food on the planet served on all seven continents even antarctica because monday night is chinese food night at mcmurdo station which is the main scientific station in antarctica so you see different varieties of chinese food for example there is french chinese food where they serve salt and pepper frog legs there is italian chinese food where they do n't have fortune cookies so they serve fried gelato my downstairs neighbor alessandra was completely shocked when i told her " dude fried gelato is not chinese " she 's like " it 's not but they serve it in all the chinese restaurants in italy " and even the brits have their own version this is a dish called crispy shredded beef which has a lot of crisp a lot of shred and not a lot of beef there is west indian chinese food there 's jamaican chinese food there is middle eastern chinese food there 's mauritian chinese food this is a dish called magic bowl that i discovered there 's indian chinese food korean chinese food japanese chinese food where they take the bao the little buns and they make them into pizza versions and they take [UNK] and they [UNK] like totally randomly they 'll take chinese noodle dishes and they 'll just ramen-ize them this is like this is something that in the chinese version has no soup so there 's peruvian chinese food which should not be mixed with mexican chinese food where they basically take things and make it look like fajitas and then [UNK] one thing they have things like risotto chop suey my personal favorite of all the restaurants i 've encountered around the world was this one in brazil called " kung food " so let 's take a step back and kind of understand what is to be appreciated in america mcdonald 's has sort of garnered a lot of attention a lot of respect for basically standardizing the menu décor and dining experience in post-world war ii america but you know what they actually did so through a centralized headquarters out of illinois right chinese restaurants have done largely the same thing i would argue with the menu and the décor [UNK] even the restaurant name [UNK] but without a centralized headquarters so this actually became very clear to me with the march 30 2005 powerball drawing where you know they expected based on the number of ticket sales they had to have three or four second-place winners [UNK] those are the people who match five or six powerball numbers instead they had 110 and they were completely shocked they looked all across the country and discovered it could n't necessarily be fraud because it happened you know in different states across different computer systems so whatever it was it caused people to sort of behave in a mass synchronized way so like ok maybe it had to do with the patterns on the little pieces of paper [UNK] you know like it was a diamond or you know diagonal it was n't that it was n't that so they 're like ok let 's look at television so they looked at an episode of " lost " now i do n't have a tv which makes me a freak but very productive and [UNK] [UNK] and this episode of " lost " i understand where the overweight guy has a lucky number which was not a lucky number which was how long they 'd been on the island but they looked and the numbers did not match so they looked at " the young and the restless " and it was n't that either so it was n't until the first guy shows up the next day and they ask him " where did you get your number from " he 's like " oh i got it from a fortune cookie " this actually is a slip that one of the winners had because the tennessee lottery security officials were like oh no [UNK] like this ca n't be true but it was true and basically of those 110 people and 104 of them or so had gotten their number from the fortune cookie yeah so i went and started looking i went across the country looking for these restaurants where these people had gotten their fortune cookies from you know there are a bunch of them including lee 's china in omaha [UNK] which is actually run by koreans but that 's another point [UNK] and a bunch of them named china buffet so what 's interesting is that their stories were similar but they were different it was lunch it was take-out it was sit-down it was buffet it was three weeks ago it was three months ago but at some point all these people had a very similar experience that converged at a fortune cookie and at a chinese restaurant and all these chinese restaurants were serving fortune cookies which of course we know are n't even chinese to begin with so it 's kind of part of the phenomenon i called spontaneous self-organization right where like in ant colonies where little decisions made by [UNK] on the micro-level actually have a big impact on the macro-level so a good sort of contrast is chicken mcnuggets mcdonald 's actually spent 10 years coming out with a chicken-like product they did chicken pot pie they did fried chicken and then they finally introduced chicken mcnuggets and the great innovation of chicken mcnuggets was not nuggetfying them because that 's kind of an easy concept but the trick behind chicken mcnuggets was they were able to remove the chicken from the bone in a cost-effective manner which is why it took so long for other people to copy them it took 10 years and then within a couple of months it was such a hit they just introduced it and rolled it across the entire system of mcdonald 's in the country in contrast we have general tso 's chicken which actually started in new york city in the early 1970s as i was also starting in the university in new york city in the early 1970s so 1 and this logo 1 so me general tso 's chicken and this logo are all karmacally related but that dish also took about 10 years to spread across america from a random restaurant in new york city someone 's like oh god [UNK] it 's sweet it 's fried it 's chicken americans will love this so what i like to say you know this being sort of bay area silicon valley [UNK] is that we think of mcdonald 's as sort of the microsoft of the dining experiences we can think of chinese restaurants perhaps as linux sort of an open source thing right where ideas from one person can be copied and propagated across the entire system that there can be specialized versions of chinese food you know depending on the region for example you know in new orleans we have cajun chinese food where they serve sichuan alligator and sweet and sour crawfish right and in philadelphia you have philadelphia cheesesteak roll which looks like an egg roll on the outside but a cheesesteak on the inside i was really surprised to discover that not only in philadelphia but also in atlanta because what had happened was that a chinese family had moved from atlanta to [UNK] sorry from philadelphia to atlanta and brought that with them so the thing is our historical lore because of the way we like narratives are full of vast characters such as you know howard schultz of starbucks and ray kroc with mcdonald 's and asa chandler with coca-cola but you know it 's very easy to overlook the smaller characters [UNK] oops [UNK] for example like lem sen who introduced chop suey chef peng who introduced general tso chicken and all the japanese bakers who introduced fortune cookies so the point of my presentation is to make you think twice that those whose names are forgotten in history can often have had as much if not more impact on what we eat today so thank you very much .this song is one of thomas ' favorites called " what you do with what you 've got " you must know someone like him he was tall and strong and lean with a body like a greyhound and a mind so sharp and keen but his heart just like laurel grew twisted around itself till almost everything he did brought pain to someone else it 's not just what you 're born with it 's what you choose to bear it 's not how big

titleReed Kroloff on modern and romantic architecturetitle transcript to be new at ted [UNK] it 's like being the last high-school virgin you know that all of the cool people are [UNK] they 're doing it and you 're on the outside you 're at home you 're like the raspyni brothers where you 've got your balls in cold water and [UNK] [UNK] you just play with your fingers all day and then you get invited and you 're on the inside and it 's everything you hoped it would be it 's exciting and there 's music playing all of the time and then suddenly it 's over and it 's only taken five minutes and you want to go back and do it again but i really appreciate being here and thank you chris and also thank you deborah patton for making this possible so anyway today we 'll talk about architecture a little bit within the subject of creation and optimism and if you put creation and optimism together you 've got two choices that you can talk about you can talk about creationism [UNK] which i think would n't go down well with this audience at least not from a view where you were a proponent of it [UNK] or you can talk about optimisations spelled the british way with an s instead of a z and i think that 's what i 'd like to talk about today but any kind of conversation about architecture [UNK] which is in fact what you were just talking about what was going on here setting up ted small-scale architecture [UNK] at the present time ca n't really happen without a conversation about this the world trade center and what 's been going on there what it means to us because if architecture is what i believe it to be which is the built form of our cultural ambitions what do you do when presented with an opportunity to rectify a situation that represents somebody else 's cultural ambitions relative to us and our own opportunity to make something new there this has been a really galvanizing issue for a long time i think that the world trade center in rather an unfortunate way brought architecture into focus in a way that i do n't think people had thought of in a long time and made it a subject for common conversation i do n't remember in my 20-year career of practicing and writing about architecture a time when five people sat me down at a table and asked me very serious questions about zoning fire exiting safety concerns and whether carpet burns these are just not things we talked about very often and yet now it 's talked about all the time at the point where you can weaponize your buildings you have to suddenly think about architecture in a very different way and so now we 're going to think about architecture in a very different way we 're going to think about it like this how many of you saw usa today today there it is looks like that there 's the world trade center site on the front cover they 've made a selection they 've chosen a project by daniel libeskind the enfant terrible of the moment of architecture child-prodigy piano player he started on the squeezebox and moved to a little more serious issue a bigger instrument and now to an even larger instrument upon which to work his particular brand of deconstructivist magic as you see here he was one of six people who were invited to participate in this competition after six previous firms struck out with things that were so stupid and banal that even the city of new york was forced to go " oh i 'm really sorry we screwed up " right can we do this again from the top except use some people with a vague hint of talent instead of just six utter boobs like we brought in last time real estate hacks of the kind who usually plan our cities let 's bring in some real architects for a change and so we got this or we had a choice of that oh stop clapping it 's too late that is gone this was a scheme by a team called think a new york-based team and then there was that one which was the libeskind scheme this one this is going to be the new world trade center a giant hole in the ground with big buildings falling into it now i do n't know what you think but i think this is a pretty stupid decision because what you 've done is just made a permanent memorial to destruction by making it look like the destruction is going to continue forever but that 's what we 're going to do but i want you to think about these things in terms of a kind of ongoing struggle that american architecture represents and that these two things talk about very specifically and that is the wild divergence in how we choose our architects in trying to decide whether we want architecture from the kind of technocratic solution to everything [UNK] that there is a large technical answer that can solve all problems be they social be they physical be they chemical [UNK] or something that 's more of a romantic solution now i do n't mean romantic as in this is a nice place to take someone on a date i mean romantic in the sense of there are things larger and grander than us so in the american tradition the difference between the technocratic and the romantic would be the difference between thomas jefferson 's cartesian grids spreading across the united states that gives us basically the whole shape of every western state in the united states as a really truly technocratic solution a bowing to the [UNK] in jefferson 's time [UNK] current popular philosophy of rationalism or the way we went to describe that later manifest destiny now which would you rather be a grid or manifest destiny manifest destiny it 's a big deal it sounds big it sounds important it sounds solid it sounds american ballsy serious male and that kind of fight has gone on back and forth in architecture all the time i mean it goes on in our private lives too every single day we all want to go out and buy an audi tt do n't we everyone here must own one or at least they craved one the moment they saw one and then they hopped in it turned the little electronic key rather than the real key zipped home on their new superhighway and drove straight into a garage that looks like a tudor castle why why why do you want to do that why do we all want to do that i even owned a tudor thing once myself it 's in our nature to go ricocheting back and forth between this technocratic solution and a larger sort of more romantic image of where we are so we 're going to go straight into this can i have the lights off for a moment i 'm going to talk about two architects very very briefly that represent the current split architecturally between these two traditions of a technocratic or technological solution and a romantic solution and these are two of the top architectural practices in the united states today one very young one a little more mature this is the work of a firm called shop and what you 're seeing here is their isometric drawings of what will be a large-scale camera obscura in a public park does everybody know what a camera obscura is yeah it 's one of those giant camera lenses that takes a picture of the outside world [UNK] it 's sort of a little movie without any moving parts [UNK] and projects it on a page and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it this is just the outline of it and you can see does it look like a regular building no it 's actually non-orthogonal it 's not up and down square rectangular anything like that that you 'd see in a normal shape of a building the computer revolution the technocratic technological revolution has allowed us to jettison normal-shaped buildings traditionally shaped buildings in favor of non-orthogonal buildings such as this what 's interesting about it is not the shape what 's interesting about it is how it 's made how it 's made a brand-new way to put buildings together something called mass customization no it is not an oxymoron what makes the building expensive in the traditional sense is making individual parts custom that you ca n't do over and over again that 's why we all live in developer houses they all want to save money by building the same thing 500 times that 's because it 's cheaper mass customization works by an architect feeding into a computer a program that says manufacture these parts the computer then talks to a machine [UNK] a computer-operated machine a cad-cam machine [UNK] that can make a zillion different changes at a moment 's notice because the computer is just a machine it does n't care it 's manufacturing the parts it does n't see any excess cost it does n't spend any extra time it 's not a laborer [UNK] it 's simply an electronic lathe so the parts can all be cut at the same time meanwhile instead of sending someone working drawings which are those huge sets of blueprints that you 've seen your whole life what the architect can do is send a set of assembly instructions like you used to get when you were a child when you bought little models that said " bolt a to b and c to d " and so what the builder will get is every single individual part that has been custom manufactured off-site and delivered on a truck to the site to that builder and a set of these instruction manuals just simple " bolt a to b " and they will be able to put them together here 's the little drawing that tells them how that works [UNK] and that 's what will happen in the end you 're underneath it looking up into the lens of the camera obscura lest you think this is all fiction lest you think this is all fantasy or romance these same architects were asked to produce something for the central courtyard of ps1 which is a museum in brooklyn new york as part of their young architects summer series and they said well it 's summer what do you do in the summer you go to the beach and when you go to the beach what do you get you get sand dunes so let 's make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana so they went out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune they took photographs they fed the photographs into their computer program and that computer program shaped a sand dune and then took that sand dune shape and turned it into [UNK] at their instructions using standard software with slight modifications [UNK] a set of instructions for pieces of wood and those are the pieces of wood those are the instructions these are the pieces and here 's a little of that blown up what you can see is there 's about six different colors and each color represents a type of wood to be cut a piece of wood to be cut all of which were delivered by flat bed on a truck and hand assembled in 48 hours by a team of eight people only one of whom had ever seen the plans before only one of whom had ever seen the plans before and here comes dune-scape coming up out of the courtyard and there it is fully built there are only 16 different pieces of wood only 16 different assembly parts here looks like a beautiful piano sounding board on the inside it has its own built-in swimming pool very very cool it 's a great place for parties [UNK] it was it was only up for six weeks it 's got little dressing rooms and cabanas where lots of interesting things went on all summer long now lest you think that this is only for the light at heart or just temporary installations this is the same firm working at the world trade center replacing the bridge that used to go across west street that very important pedestrian connection between the city of new york and the redevelopment of the west side they were asked to design replace that bridge in six weeks building it including all of the parts manufactured and they were able to do it that was their design using that same computer modeling system and only five or six really different kinds of parts a couple of struts like this some exterior cladding material and a very simple framing system that was all manufactured off-site and delivered by truck they were able to create that they were able to create something wonderful they 're now building a 16-story building on the side of new york using the same technology here we 're going to walk across the bridge at night it 's self-lit you do n't need any overhead lighting so the neighbors do n't complain about metal-halide lighting in their face here it is going across and there down the other side and you get the same kind of grandeur now let me show you quickly the opposite if i may woo pretty huh this is the other side of the coin this is the work of david rockwell from new york city whose work you can see out here today the current king of the romantics who approaches his work in a very different fashion it 's not to create a technological solution it 's to seduce you into something that you can do into something that will please you something that will lift your spirits something that will make you feel as if are in another world [UNK] such as his nobu restaurant in new york which is supposed to take you from the clutter of new york city to the simplicity of japan and the elegance of japanese tradition " when it 's all said and done it 's got to look like seaweed " said the owner or his restaurant pod in philadelphia pennsylvania i want you to know the room you 're looking at is stark white every single surface of this restaurant is white the reason it has so much color is that it changes using lighting it 's all about sensuality it 's all about transforming watch this [UNK] i 'm not touching any buttons ladies and gentlemen this is happening by itself it transforms through the magic of lighting it 's all about sensuality it 's all about touch rosa mexicano restaurant where he transports us to the shores of acapulco up on the upper west side with this wall of cliff divers who [UNK] there you go like that let 's see it one more time okay just to make sure that you 've enjoyed it and finally it 's about comfort it 's about making you feel good in places that you would n't have felt good before it 's about bringing nature to the inside in the guardian tower of new york converted to a w union square [UNK] i 'm sorry i 'm rushing [UNK] where we had to bring in the best horticulturists in the world to make sure that the interior of this dragged the garden space of the court garden of the union square into the building itself it 's about stimulation this is a wine-buying experience simplified by color and taste fizzy fresh soft luscious juicy smooth big and sweet wines all explained to you by color and texture on the wall and finally it 's about entertainment as in his headquarters for the cirque du soleil orlando florida where you 're asked to enter the greek theater look under the tent and join the magic world of cirque du soleil and i think i 'll probably leave it at that thank you very much .the future that we will create can be a future that we 'll be proud of i think about this every day it 's quite literally my job i 'm co-founder and senior columnist at worldchanging.com alex steffen and i founded worldchanging in late 2003 and since then we and our growing global team of contributors have documented the ever-expanding variety of solutions that are out there right now and on the near horizon in a little over two years we 've written up about 4,000 items [UNK] replicable models technological tools emerging ideas [UNK] all providing a path to a future that 's more sustainable more equitable and more desirable our emphasis on solutions is quite intentional there are tons of places to go online and off if what you want to find is the latest bit of news about just how quickly our hell-bound handbasket is moving we want to offer people an idea of what they can do about it we focus primarily on the planet 's environment but we also address issues of global development international conflict responsible use of emerging technologies even the rise of the so-called second superpower and much much more the scope of solutions that we discuss is actually pretty broad but that reflects both the range of challenges that need to be met and the kinds of innovations that will allow us to do so a quick sampling really can barely scratch the surface but to give you a sense of what we cover tools for rapid disaster relief such as this inflatable concrete shelter innovative uses of bioscience such as a flower that changes color in the presence of landmines ultra high-efficiency designs for homes and offices distributed power generation using solar power wind power ocean power other clean energy sources ultra ultra high-efficiency vehicles of the future ultra high-efficiency vehicles you can get right now and better urban design so you do n't need to drive as much in the first place bio-mimetic approaches to design that take advantage of the efficiencies of natural models in both vehicles and buildings distributed computing projects that will help us model the future of the climate also a number of the topics that we 've been talking about this week at ted are things that we 've addressed in the past on worldchanging cradle-to-cradle design mit 's fab labs the consequences of extreme longevity the one laptop per child project even gapminder as a born-in-the-mid-1960s gen x-er hurtling all too quickly to my fortieth birthday i 'm naturally inclined to pessimism but working at worldchanging has convinced me much to my own surprise that successful responses to the world 's problems are nonetheless possible moreover i 've come to realize that focusing only on negative outcomes can really blind you to the very possibility of success as norwegian social scientist evelin lindner has observed " pessimism is a luxury of good times 1 in difficult times pessimism is a self-fulfilling self-inflicted death sentence " the truth is we can build a better world and we can do so right now we have the tools we saw a hint of that a moment ago and we 're coming up with new ones all the time we have the knowledge and our understanding of the planet improves every day most importantly we have the motive we have a world that needs fixing and nobody 's going to do it for us many of the solutions that i and my colleagues seek out and write up every day have some important aspects in common transparency collaboration a willingness to experiment and an appreciation of science [UNK] or more appropriately science 1 the majority of models tools and ideas on worldchanging encompass combinations of these characteristics so i want to give you a few concrete examples of how these principles combine in world-changing ways we can see world-changing values in the emergence of tools to make the invisible visible [UNK] that is to make apparent the conditions of the world around us that would otherwise be largely imperceptible we know that people often change their behavior when they can see and understand the impact of their actions as a small example many of us have experienced the change in driving behavior that comes from having a real time display of mileage showing precisely how one 's driving habits affect the vehicle 's efficiency the last few years have all seen the rise of innovations in how we measure and display aspects of the world that can be too big or too intangible or too slippery to grasp easily simple technologies like wall-mounted devices that display how much power your household is using and what kind of results you 'll get if you turn off a few lights [UNK] these can actually have a direct positive impact on your energy footprint community tools like text messaging that can tell you when pollen counts are up or smog levels are rising or a natural disaster is unfolding can give you the information you need to act in a timely fashion data-rich displays like maps of campaign contributions or maps of the disappearing polar ice caps allow us to better understand the context and the flow of processes that affect us all we can see world-changing values in research projects that seek to meet the world 's medical needs through open access to data and collaborative action now some people emphasize the risks of knowledge-enabled dangers but i 'm convinced that the benefits of knowledge-enabled solutions are far more important for example open-access journals like the public library of science make cutting-edge scientific research free to all [UNK] everyone in the world and actually a growing number of science publishers are adopting this model last year hundreds of volunteer biology and chemistry researchers around the world worked together to sequence the genome of the parasite responsible for some of the developing world 's worst diseases african sleeping sickness leishmaniasis and chagas disease that genome data can now be found on open-access genetic data banks around the world and it 's an enormous boon to researchers trying to come up with treatments but my favorite example has to be the global response to the sars epidemic in 2003 2004 which relied on worldwide access to the full gene sequence of the sars virus the u.s. national research council in its follow-up report on the outbreak specifically cited this open availability of the sequence as a key reason why the treatment for sars could be developed so quickly and we can see world-changing values in something as humble as a cell phone i can probably count on my fingers the number of people in this room who do not use a mobile phone [UNK] and where is aubrey because i know he does n't for many of us cell phones have really become almost an extension of ourselves and we 're really now beginning to see the social changes that mobile phones can bring about you may already know some of the big-picture aspects globally more camera phones were sold last year than any other kind of camera and a growing number of people live lives mediated through the lens and over the network [UNK] and sometimes enter history books in the developing world mobile phones have become economic drivers a study last year showed a direct correlation between the growth of mobile phone use and subsequent gdp increases across africa in kenya mobile phone minutes have actually become an alternative currency the political aspects of mobile phones ca n't be ignored either from text message swarms in korea helping to bring down a government to the blairwatch project in the uk keeping tabs on politicians who try to avoid the press and it 's just going to get more wild pervasive always-on networks high quality sound and video even devices made to be worn instead of carried in the pocket will transform how we live on a scale that few really appreciate it 's no exaggeration to say that the mobile phone may be among the world 's most important technologies and in this rapidly evolving context it 's possible to imagine a world in which the mobile phone becomes something far more than a medium for social interaction i 've long admired the witness project and peter gabriel told us more details about it on wednesday in his profoundly moving presentation and i 'm just incredibly happy to see the news that witness is going to be opening up a web portal to enable users of digital cameras and camera phones to send in their recordings over the internet rather than just hand-carrying the videotape not only does this add a new and potentially safer avenue for documenting abuses it opens up the program to the growing global digital generation now imagine a similar model for networking environmentalists imagine a web portal collecting recordings and evidence of what 's happening to the planet putting news and data at the fingertips of people of all kinds from activists and researchers to businesspeople and political figures it would highlight the changes that are underway but would more importantly give voice to the people who are willing to work to see a new world a better world come about it would give everyday citizens a chance to play a role in the protection of the planet it would be in essence an " earth witness " project now just to be clear in this talk i 'm using the name " earth witness " as part of the scenario simply as a shorthand for what this imaginary project could aspire to not to piggyback on the wonderful work of the witness organization it could just as easily be called " environmental transparency project " " smart mobs for natural security " [UNK] but earth witness is a lot easier to say now many of the people who participate in earth witness would focus on ecological problems human-caused or otherwise especially environmental crimes and significant sources of greenhouse gases and emissions that 's understandable and important we need better documentation of what 's happening to the planet if we 're ever going to have a chance of repairing the damage but the earth witness project would n't need to be limited to problems in the best worldchanging tradition it might also serve as a showcase for good ideas successful projects and efforts to make a difference that deserve much more visibility earth witness would show us two worlds the world we 're leaving behind and the world we 're building for generations to come and what makes this scenario particularly appealing to me is we could do it today the key components are already widely available camera phones of course would be fundamental to the project and for a lot of us they 're as close as we have yet to always-on widely available information tools we may not remember to bring our digital cameras with us wherever we go but very few of us forget our phones you could even imagine a version of this scenario in which people actually build their own phones over the course of last year open-source hardware hackers have come up with multiple models for usable linux-based mobile phones and the earth phone could spin off from this kind of project at the other end of the network there 'd be a server for people to send photos and messages to accessible over the web combining a photo-sharing service social networking platforms and a collaborative filtering system now you web 2.0 folks in the audience know what i 'm talking about but for those of you for whom that last sentence was in a crazy moon language i mean simply this the online part of the earth witness project would be created by the users working together and working openly that 's enough right there to start to build a compelling chronicle of what 's now happening to our planet but we could do more an earth witness site could also serve as a collection spot for all sorts of data about conditions around the planet picked up by environmental sensors that attach to your cell phone now you do n't see these devices as add-ons for phones yet but students and engineers around the world have attached atmospheric sensors to bicycles and handheld computers and cheap robots and the backs of pigeons [UNK] that being a project that 's actually underway right now at u.c irvine using bird-mounted sensors as a way of measuring smog-forming pollution it 's hardly a stretch to imagine putting the same thing on a phone carried by a person now the idea of connecting a sensor to your phone is not new phone-makers around the world offer phones that sniff for bad breath or tell you to worry about too much sun exposure swedish firm uppsala biomedical more seriously makes a mobile phone add-on that can process blood tests in the field uploading the data displaying the results even the lawrence livermore national labs have gotten into the act designing a prototype phone that has radiation sensors to find dirty bombs now there 's an enormous variety of tiny inexpensive sensors on the market and you can easily imagine someone putting together a phone that could measure temperature co2 or methane levels the presence of some biotoxins [UNK] potentially in a few years maybe even h5n1 avian flu virus you could see that some kind of system like this would actually be a really good fit with larry brilliant 's instedd project now all of this data could be tagged with geographic information and mashed up with online maps for easy viewing and analysis and that 's worth noting in particular the impact of open-access online maps over the last year or two has been simply phenomenal developers around the world have come up with an amazing variety of ways to layer useful data on top of the maps from bus routes and crime statistics to the global progress of avian flu earth witness would take this further linking what you see with what thousands or millions of other people see around the world it 's kind of exciting to think about what might be accomplished if something like this ever existed we 'd have a far better [UNK] far better knowledge of what 's happening on our planet environmentally than could be gathered with satellites and a handful of government sensor nets alone it would be a collaborative bottom-up approach to environmental awareness and protection able to respond to emerging concerns in a smart mobs kind of way [UNK] and if you need greater sensor density just have more people show up and most important you ca n't ignore how important mobile phones are to global youth this is a system that could put the next generation at the front lines of gathering environmental data and as we work to figure out ways to mitigate the worst effects of climate disruption every little bit of information matters a system like earth witness would be a tool for all of us to participate in the improvement of our knowledge and ultimately the improvement of the planet itself now as i suggested at the outset there are thousands upon thousands of good ideas out there so why have i spent the bulk of my time telling you about something that does n't exist because this is what tomorrow could look like bottom-up technology-enabled global collaboration to handle the biggest crisis our civilization has ever faced we can save the planet but we ca n't do it alone [UNK] we need each other nobody 's going to fix the world for us but working together making use of technological innovations and human communities alike we might just be able to fix it ourselves we have at our fingertips a cornucopia of compelling models powerful tools and innovative ideas that can make a meaningful difference in our planet 's future we do n't need to wait for a magic bullet to save us all we already have an arsenal of solutions just waiting to be used there 's a staggering array of wonders out there across diverse disciplines all telling us the same thing success can be ours if we 're willing to try and as we say at worldchanging another world is n't just possible another world is here we just need to open our eyes thank you very much .i 'm a contemporary artist and i show in art galleries and museums i show a number of photographs and films but i also make television programs books and some advertising all with the same concept and it 's about our fixation with celebrity and celebrity culture and the importance of the image celebrity is born of photography i 'm going to start with how i started with this concept seven years ago when princess diana died there was a sort of a standstill in britain the moment of her death and people decided to mourn her death in a sort of mass way i was fascinated by this phenomenon so i wondered could one erase the image of diana actually quite crudely and physically so i got a gun and started to shoot at the image of diana but i could n't erase this from my memory and certainly it was not being erased from the public psyche momentum was being built the press wrote about her death in rather i felt pornographic ways [UNK] like " which bit of artery left which bit of body " and " how did she die in the back of the car " [UNK] and i was intrigued by this sort of mass voyeurism so i made these rather gory images i then went on wondering whether i could actually replace her image so i got a look-alike of diana and posed her in the right positions and angles and created something that was in or existed in the public imagination so people were wondering was she going to marry dodi was she in love with him was she pregnant did she want his baby was she pregnant when she died so i created this image of diana dodi and their imaginary mixed-race child and this image came out which caused a huge public outcry at the time i then went on to make more comments on the media and press imagery so i started making reference to media imagery [UNK] made it grainy shot through doorways and so on and so forth [UNK] to titillate the public or the viewer further in terms of trying to make the viewer more aware of their own voyeurism so this is an image of diana looking at camilla kissing her husband and this was a sequence of images and this gets shown in art galleries like this as a sequence and similarly with the di-dodian baby imagery [UNK] this is another art gallery installation i 'm particularly interested in how you ca n't rely on your own perception this is jane smith and jo bloggs for instance but you think it 's camilla and the queen and i 'm fascinated how what you think is real is n't necessarily real and the camera can lie and it makes it very very easy with the mass bombardment of imagery to tell untruths so i continued to work on this project of how photography seduces us and is more interesting to look at than the actual real subject matter and at the same time it removes us from the real subject matter and this acts as a sort of titillating thing so the photograph becomes this teaser and incites desire and voyeurism what you ca n't have you want more in the photograph the real subject does n't exist so it makes you want that person more and that is the way i think that celebrity magazines work now the more pictures you see of these celebrities the more you feel you know them but you do n't know them and you want to know them further of course the queen goes to her stud often to watch her horses 1 watch her horses and then i was sort of making imagery in england there 's an expression " you ca n't imagine the queen on the loo " so i 'm trying to penetrate that well here is the image all this imagery was creating a lot of fuss and i was cited as a disgusting artist the press were writing about this giving full pages about how terrible this was which i found very interesting that it was going full cycle i was making comments about the press and about how we know facts and information only by media [UNK] because we do n't know the real people very few of us know the real people [UNK] but it was going back into the press and they were publicizing effectively my filthy work so these are broadsheets tabloids debates were being had all about this work films were being banned before people had actually had the look at the work politicians were getting involved [UNK] all sorts of things [UNK] great headlines then suddenly it started to get on front pages i was being asked and paid to do front covers suddenly i was becoming sort of acceptable which i found also fascinating how one moment [UNK] it was disgusting [UNK] journalists would lie to me to get a story or a photograph of me saying my work was wonderful and the next minute there were terrible headlines about me but then this changed suddenly i then started to work for magazines and newspapers this was for example an image that went into tatler this was another newspaper image it was an april fool actually and to this day some people think it 's real i was sitting next to someone at dinner the other day and they were saying there 's this great image of the queen sitting outside william hill they thought it was real i was exploring at the time the hyperbole of icons [UNK] and diana and marilyn [UNK] and the importance of celebrity in our lives how they wheedle their way into the collective psyche without us even knowing and how that should happen i explored with actually dressing up as the celebrities myself there 's me as diana [UNK] i look like the mass murderer myra hindley i think in this one and me as the queen i then continued on to make a whole body of work about marilyn [UNK] the biggest icon of all [UNK] and trying to titillate by shooting through doorways and shutters and so on and so forth and only showing certain angles to create a reality that obviously is completely constructed this is the look-alike so the crafting elements of this is completely enormous she looks nothing like marilyn but by the time we 've made her up and put wigs and makeup on she looks exactly like marilyn to the extent that her husband could n't recognize her [UNK] or recognize this look-alike [UNK] in these photographs which i find quite interesting so all this work is getting shown in art galleries then i made a book i was also making a tv series for the bbc at the time stills from the tv series went into this book but there was a real legal problem because it looks real but how do you get over that because obviously it 's making a comment about our culture right now that we ca n't tell what 's real how do we know when we 're looking at something whether it 's real or not so from my point of view it 's important to publish it but at the same time it does cause a confusion [UNK] intentional on my behalf but problematic for any outlet that i 'm working with so a big disclaimer is put on everything that i do and i made narratives about all the european or brit celebrities and comments about our public figures you know what does tony blair get up to in private with his fashion guru and also dealing with the perceptions that are put about bin laden saddam hussein the links that were put about pre-iraq war and what is going to happen to the monarchy because obviously the british public i think would prefer william to charles on the throne and it 's that wish or that desire that i suppose i 'm dealing with in my work i 'm not really interested in the celebrity themselves i 'm interested in the perception of the celebrity and with some look-alikes they are so good you do n't know whether they 're real or not i did an advertising campaign for schweppes which is coca-cola and so that was very interesting in terms of the legalities it 's highly commercial but it was a difficulty for me [UNK] because this is my artwork should i do advertising [UNK] at the time so i made sure the work was not compromised in any way and that the integrity of the work remained the same but the meanings changed in the sense that with the logo on you 're closing all the lines of interpretation down to selling a product and that 's all you 're doing when you take the logo off you 're opening up the interpretations and making the work inconclusive opposed to conclusive when you are advertising this image is quite interesting actually because i think we made it three years ago and it 's camilla in her wedding dress which again nearly got re-used now recently prior to her wedding tony blair and cherie and again the legalities [UNK] we had to be very careful it 's obviously a very big commercial company and so this little " shh [UNK] it 's not really them " was put on the side of the imagery and margaret thatcher visiting jeffery archer in jail i then was asked by selfridges to do a series of windows for them so i built a sauna bath in one of their windows and created little scenes [UNK] live scenes with look-alikes inside the windows and the windows were all steamed up so it 's tony blair reading and practicing his speech i 've got them doing yoga inside there with carole caplin sven making out with ulrika jonsson who he was having an affair with at that time this was a huge success for them because the imagery got shown in the press the day after in every single newspaper broadsheets and tabloids it was a bit of a road stopper which was problematic because the police kept on trying to clear away the crowds but huge fun [UNK] it was great for me to do a performance also people were taking photographs of this so it was being texted around the world extremely quickly all this imagery and the press were interviewing and i was signing my book further imagery i 'm making a new book now with taschen that i 'm working on really for a sort of global market [UNK] my previous book was only for the u.k. market [UNK] that i suppose it could be called humorous i suppose i come from a sort of non-humorous background with serious intent and then suddenly my work is funny and i think it does n't really matter that my work is considered humorous in a way i think it 's a way in for me to deal with the importance of imagery and how we read all our information through imagery it 's an extremely fast way of getting information it 's extremely difficult if it 's constructed correctly and there are techniques of constructing iconic imagery this image for example is sort of spot-on because it exactly sums up what elton may be doing in private and also what might be happening with saddam hussein and george bush reading the koran upside-down for example george bush target practice [UNK] shooting at bin laden and michael moore and then you change the photograph he 's shooting at and it suddenly becomes rather grim and maybe less accessible tony blair being used as a mounting block and rumsfeld and bush laughing with some abu ghraib photos behind and the seriousness or the intellect of bush and also commenting on the behind the scenes [UNK] well as we know now [UNK] what goes on in prisons and in fact george bush and tony blair are having great fun during all of this and really commenting you know based on the perception we have of the celebrities what jack nicholson might be up to in his celebrity life and the fact that he tried to 1 he had a bit of road rage and golf-clubbed a driver the other day i mean it 's extremely difficult to find these look-alikes so i 'm constantly going up to people in the street and trying to ask people to come and be in one of my photographs or films and sometimes asking the real celebrity mistaking them for someone who just looks like the real person which is highly embarrassing i 've also been working with the guardian on a topical basis [UNK] a page a week in their newspaper [UNK] which has been very interesting working topically so jamie oliver and school dinners bush and blair having difficulty getting alongside muslim culture the whole of the hunting issue and the royal family refusing to stop hunting and the tsunami issues and obviously harry blair 's views on gordon brown which i find very interesting condi and bush this image i 've decided to show having a reservation about it i made it a year ago and just how meanings change and there were a terrible thing that has happened but the fear is lurking around in our minds prior to that that 's why this image was made one year ago and what it means today so i 'll leave you with these clips to have a look chris anderson thank you .cholera was reported in haiti for the first time in over 50 years last october there was no way to predict how far it would spread through water supplies and how bad the situation would get and not knowing where help was needed always ensured that help was in short supply in the areas that needed it most we 've gotten good at predicting and preparing for storms before they take innocent lives and cause irreversible damage but we still ca n't do that with water and here 's why right now if you want to test water in the field you need a trained technician expensive equipment like this and you have to wait about a day for chemical reactions to take place and provide results it 's too slow to get a picture of conditions on the ground before they change too expensive to implement in all the places that require testing and it ignores the fact that in the meanwhile people still need to drink water most of the information that we collected on the cholera outbreak did n't come from testing water it came from forms like this which documented all the people we failed to help countless lives have been saved by canaries in coalmines [UNK] a simple and invaluable way for miners to know whether they 're safe i 've been inspired by that simplicity as i 've been working on this problem with some of the most hardworking and brilliant people i 've ever known we think there 's a simpler solution to this problem [UNK] one that can be used by people who face conditions like this everyday it 's in its early stages but this is what it looks like right now we call it the water canary it 's a fast cheap device that answers an important question is this water contaminated it does n't require any special training and instead of waiting for chemical reactions to take place it uses light that means there 's no waiting for chemical reactions to take place no need to use reagents that can run out and no need to be an expert to get actionable information to test water you simply insert a sample and within seconds it either displays a red light indicating contaminated water or a green light indicating the sample is safe this will make it possible for anyone to collect life-saving information and to monitor water quality conditions as they unfold we 're also on top of that integrating wireless networking into an affordable device with gps and gsm what that means is that each reading can be automatically transmitted to servers to be mapped in real time with enough users maps like this will make it possible to take preventive action containing hazards before they turn into emergencies that take years to recover from and then instead of taking days to disseminate this information to the people who need it most it can happen automatically we 've seen how distributed networks big data and information can transform society i think it 's time for us to apply them to water our goal over the next year is to get water canary ready for the field and to open-source the hardware so that anyone can contribute to the development and the evaluation so we can tackle this problem together thank you .restaurants and the food industry in general are pretty much the most wasteful industry in the world for every calorie of food that we consume here in britain today 10 calories are taken to produce it that 's a lot i want to take something rather humble to discuss i found this in the farmers ' market today and if anybody wants to take it home and mash it later you 're very welcome to the humble potato [UNK] and i 've spent a long time 25 years preparing these and it pretty much goes through eight different forms in its lifetime first of all it 's planted and that takes energy it grows and is nurtured it 's then harvested it 's then distributed and distribution is a massive issue it 's then sold and bought and it 's then delivered to me i basically take it prepare it and then people consume it [UNK] hopefully they enjoy it the last stage is basically waste and this is is pretty much where everybody disregards it there are different types of waste there 's a waste of time there 's a waste of space there 's a waste of energy and there 's a waste of waste and every business i 've been working on over the past five years i 'm trying to lower each one of these elements okay so you ask what a sustainable restaurant looks like basically a restaurant just like any other this is the restaurant acorn house front and back so let me run you through a few ideas floor sustainable recyclable chairs recycled and recyclable tables forestry commission this is norwegian forestry commission wood this bench although it was uncomfortable for my mom [UNK] she did n't like sitting on it so she went and bought these cushions for me from a local jumble sale [UNK] reusing a job that was pretty good i hate waste especially walls if they 're not working put a shelf on it which i did and that shows all the customers my products the whole business is run on sustainable energy this is powered by wind all of the lights are daylight bulbs paint is all low-volume chemical which is very important when you 're working in the room all the time i was experimenting with these [UNK] i do n't know if you can see it [UNK] but there 's a work surface there and that 's a plastic polymer and i was thinking well i 'm trying to think nature nature nature but i thought no no experiment with resins experiment with polymers will they outlive me they probably might right here 's a reconditioned coffee machine it actually looks better than a brand new one [UNK] so looking good there now reusing is vital and we filter our own water we put them in bottles refrigerate them and then we reuse that bottle again and again and again here 's a great little example if you can see this orange tree it 's actually growing in a car tire which has been turned inside out and sewn up it 's got my compost in it which is growing an orange tree which is great this is the kitchen which is in the same room i basically created a menu that allowed people to choose the amount and volume of food that they wanted to consume rather than me putting a dish down they were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they wanted okay it 's a small kitchen it 's about five square meters it serves 220 people a day we generate quite a lot of waste this is the waste room you ca n't get rid of waste but this story 's not about eliminating it it 's about minimizing it in here i have produce and boxes that are unavoidable i put my food waste into this dehydrating desiccating macerator [UNK] turns food into an inner material which i can store and then compost later i compost it in this garden all of the soil you can see there is basically my food which is generated by the restaurant and it 's growing in these tubs which i made out of storm-felled trees and wine casks and all kinds of things three compost bins [UNK] go through about 70 kilos of raw vegetable waste a week [UNK] really good makes fantastic compost a couple of wormeries in there too and actually one of the wormeries was a big wormery i had a lot of worms in it and i tried taking the dried food waste putting it to the worms going " there you go dinner " it was like vegetable jerky and killed all of them i do n't know how many worms [ were ] in there but i 've got some heavy karma coming i tell you what you 're seeing here is a water filtration system this takes the water out of the restaurant runs it through these stone beds [UNK] this is going to be mint in there [UNK] and i sort of water the garden with it and i ultimately want to recycle that put it back into the loos maybe wash hands with it i do n't know so water is a very important aspect i started meditating on that and created a restaurant called waterhouse if i could get waterhouse to be a no-carbon restaurant that is consuming no gas to start with that would be great i managed to do it this restaurant looks a little bit like acorn house [UNK] same chairs same tables they 're all english and a little bit more sustainable but this is an electrical restaurant the whole thing is electric the restaurant and the kitchen and it 's run on hydroelectricity so i 've gone from air to water now it 's important to understand that this room is cooled by water heated by water filters its own water and it 's powered by water it literally is waterhouse the air handling system inside it [UNK] i got rid of air-conditioning because i thought there was too much consumption going on there this is basically air-handling i 'm taking the temperature of the canal outside pumping it through the heat exchange mechanism it 's turning through these amazing sails on the roof and that in turn is falling softly onto the people in the restaurant cooling them or heating them as the need may be and this is an english willow air diffuser and that 's softly moving that air current through the room very advanced no air-conditioning [UNK] i love it in the canal which is just outside the restaurant there is hundreds of meters of coil piping this takes the temperature of the canal and turns it into this four-degrees of heat exchange i have no idea how it works but i paid a lot of money for it and what 's great is one of the chefs who works in that restaurant lives on this boat [UNK] it 's off-grid it generates all its own power he 's growing all his own fruit and that 's fantastic there 's no accident in names of these restaurants acorn house is the element of wood waterhouse is the element of water and i 'm thinking well i 'm going to be making five restaurants based on the five chinese medicine acupuncture specialities i 've got water and wood i 'm just about to do fire i 've got metal and earth to come so you 've got to watch your space for that okay so this is my next project five weeks old it 's my baby and it 's hurting real bad the people 's supermarket so basically the restaurants only really hit people who believed in what i was doing anyway what i needed to do was get food out to a broader spectrum of people so people [UNK] i.e. perhaps more working-class [UNK] or perhaps people who actually believe in a cooperative this is a social enterprise not-for-profit cooperative supermarket it really is about the social disconnect between food communities in urban settings and their relationship to rural growers [UNK] connecting communities in london to rural growers really important so i 'm committing to potatoes i 'm committing to milk i 'm committing to leeks and broccoli [UNK] all very important stuff i 've kept the tiles i 've kept the floors i 've kept the trunking i 've got in some recycled fridges i 've got some recycled tills i 've got some recycled trolleys i mean the whole thing is is super-sustainable in fact i 'm trying and i 'm going to make this the most sustainable supermarket in the world that 's zero food waste and no one 's doing that just yet in fact sainsbury 's if you 're watching i 'm going to get there before you so nature does n't create waste does n't create waste as such everything in nature is used up in a closed continuous cycle with waste being the end of the beginning and that 's been something that 's been nurturing me for some time and it 's an important statement to understand if we do n't stand up and make a difference and think about sustainable food think about the sustainable nature of it then we may fail but i wanted to get up and show you that we can do it if we 're more responsible environmentally conscious businesses are doable they 're here you can see i 've done three so far i 've got a few more to go the idea is embryonic i think it 's important i think that if we reduce reuse refuse and recycle [UNK] right at the end there [UNK] recycling is the last point i want to make but it 's the four r 's rather than the three r 's [UNK] then i think we 're going to be on our way so these three are not perfect [UNK] they 're ideas i think that there are many problems to come but with help i 'm sure i 'm going to find solutions and i hope you all take part thank you very much transcript urlhttpwww.ted.comtalkstheo_jansen_creates_new_creatures.htmlurl descriptionArtist Theo Jansen demonstrates the amazingly lifelike kinetic sculptures he builds from plastic tubes and lemonade bottles. His creatures are designed to move -- and even survive -- on their own.description keywordsanimals,art,arts,biomechanics,creativity,demo,design,entertainment,short talk,technologykeywords talkid162talkid titleTheo Jansen creates new creaturestitle transcript i would like to tell you about a project which i started about 16 years ago and it 's about making new forms of life and these are made of this kind of tube [UNK] electricity tube we call it in holland and we can start a film about that and we can see a little bit backwards in time narrator eventually these beasts are going to live in herds on the beaches theo jansen is working hard on this evolution theo jansen i want to put these forms of life on the beaches and they should survive over there on their own in the future learning to live on their own [UNK] and it 'll take couple of more years to let them walk on their own narrator the mechanical beasts will not get their energy from food but from the wind the wind will move feathers on their back which will drive their feet the beast walks sideways on the wet sand of the beach with its nose pointed into the wind as soon as it walks into either the rolling surf or the dry sand it stops and walks in the opposite direction evolution has generated many species this is the animaris currens ventosa tj this is a herd and it is built according to genetical codes and it is a sort of race and each and every animal is different and the winning codes will multiply this is the wave going from left to right you can see this one and now it goes from [UNK] yes now it goes from left to right this is a new generation a new family which is able to store the winds so the wings pump up air in lemonade bottles which are on top of that and they can use that energy in case the wind falls away and the tide is coming up and there is still a little bit of energy to reach the dunes and save their lives because they are drowned very easily i could show you this animal thank you so the proportion of the tubes in this animal is very important for the walking there are 11 numbers which i call the 11 holy numbers these are the distances of the tubes which make it walk that way in fact it 's a new invention of the wheel it works the same as a wheel the axis of a wheel is staying on the same level and this hip is staying on the same level as well in fact this is better than a wheel because when you try to drive with your bicycle on the beach you will notice it 's very hard to do and the feet just step over the sand and the wheel has to touch every piece of the ground in between so 5,000 years after the invention of the wheel we have a new wheel and i will show you in the next video [UNK] can you start it please [UNK] that very heavy loads can be moved there 's a guy pushing there behind but can also walk on the wind very well it 's 3.2 tons and this is working on the stored winds in the bottles it has a feeler where it can feel obstacles and turn around and that stuff you see is going to it the other way can i have the feeler here ok. good so they have to survive all the dangers of the beach and one of the big dangers is the sea this is the sea and it must feel the water of the sea and this is the water feeler and what 's very important is this tube it sucks in air normally but when it swallows water it feels the resistance of it so imagine that the animal is walking towards the sea as soon as it touches the water you should hear a sort of sound of running air yes 1 so if it does n't feel it will be drowned ok here we have the brain of the animal in fact it is a step counter and it counts the steps it 's a binary step counter so as soon it has been to the sea it changes the pattern of zeroes and ones here and it knows always where it is on the beach so it 's very simple brain it says well there 's the sea there are dunes and i 'm here so it 's a sort of imagination of the simple world of the beach animal thank you one of the biggest enemies are the storms this is a part of the nose of the animaris percipiere and when the nose is fixed [UNK] of the animal [UNK] the whole animal is fixed so when the storm is coming up it drives a pin into the ground and the nose is fixed the whole animal is fixed the wind may turn but the animal will turn always its nose into the wind now another couple of years and these animals will survive on their own i still have to help them a lot thank you very much ladies and gentlemen .i 'm a garbage man and you might find it interesting that i became a garbage man because i absolutely hate waste i hope within the next 10 minutes to change the way you think about a lot of the stuff in your life and i 'd like to start at the very beginning think back when you were just a kid how did look at the stuff in your life perhaps it was like these toddler rules it 's my stuff if i saw it first the entire pile is my stuff if i 'm building something the more stuff that 's mine the better and of course it 's your stuff if it 's broken well after spending about 20 years in the recycling industry it 's become pretty clear to me that we do n't necessarily leave these toddler rules behind as we develop into adults and let me tell you why i have that perspective because each and every day at our recycling plants around the world we handle about one million pounds of people 's discarded stuff now a million pounds a day sounds like a lot of stuff but it 's a tiny drop of the durable goods that are disposed each and every year around the world [UNK] well less than one percent in fact the united nations estimates that there 's about 85 billion pounds a year of electronics waste that gets discarded around the world each and every year [UNK] and that 's one of the most rapidly growing parts of our waste stream and if you throw in other durable goods like automobiles and so forth that number well more than doubles and of course the more developed the country the bigger these mountains now when you see these mountains most people think of garbage we see above-ground mines and the reason we see mines is because there 's a lot of valuable raw materials that went into making all of this stuff in the first place and it 's becoming increasingly important that we figure out how to extract these raw materials from these extremely complicated waste streams because as we 've heard all week at ted the world 's getting to be a smaller place with more people in it who want more and more stuff and of course they want the toys and the tools that many of us take for granted and what goes into making those toys and tools that we use every single day it 's mostly many types of plastics and many types of metals and the metals we typically get from ore that we mine in ever widening mines and ever deepening mines around the world and the plastics we get from oil which we go to more remote locations and drill ever deeper wells to extract and these practices have significant economic and environmental implications that we 're already starting to see today the good news is we are starting to recover materials from our end-of-life stuff and starting to recycle our end-of-life stuff particularly in regions of the world like here in europe that have recycling policies in place that require that this stuff be recycled in a responsible manner most of what 's extracted from our end-of-life stuff if it makes it to a recycler are the metals to put that in perspective [UNK] and i 'm using steel as a proxy here for metals because it 's the most common metal [UNK] if your stuff makes it to a recycler probably over 90 percent of the metals are going to be recovered and reused for another purpose plastics are a whole other story well less than 10 percent are recovered in fact it 's more like five percent most of it 's incinerated or landfilled now most people think that 's because plastics are a throw-away material have very little value but actually plastics are several times more valuable than steel and there 's more plastics produced and consumed around the world on a volume basis every year than steel so why is such a plentiful and valuable material not recovered at anywhere near the rate of the less valuable material well it 's predominantly because metals are very easy to recycle from other materials and from one another they have very different densities they have different electrical and magnetic properties and they even have different colors so it 's very easy for either humans or machines to separate these metals from one another and from other materials plastics have overlapping densities over a very narrow range they have either identical or very similar electrical and magnetic properties and any plastic can be any color as you probably well know so the traditional ways of separating materials just simply do n't work for plastics another consequence of metals being so easy to recycle by humans is that a lot of our stuff from the developed world [UNK] and sadly to say particularly from the united states where we do n't have any recycling policies in place like here in europe [UNK] finds its way to developing countries for low-cost recycling people for as little as a dollar a day pick through our stuff they extract what they can which is mostly the metals [UNK] circuit boards and so forth [UNK] and they leave behind mostly what they ca n't recover which is again mostly the plastics or they burn the plastics to get to the metals in burn houses like you see here and they extract the metals by hand now while this may be the low-economic-cost solution this is certainly not the low-environmental or human health-and-safety solution i call this environmental arbitrage and it 's not fair it 's not safe and it 's not sustainable now because the plastics are so plentiful [UNK] and by the way those other methods do n't lead to the recovery of plastics obviously [UNK] but people do try to recover the plastics this is just one example this is a photo i took standing on the rooftops of one of the largest slums in the world in mumbai india they store the plastics on the roofs they bring them below those roofs into small workshops like these and people try very hard to separate the plastics by color by shape by feel by any technique they can and sometimes they 'll resort to what 's known as the " burn and sniff " technique where they 'll burn the plastic and smell the fumes to try to determine the type of plastic none of these techniques result in any amount of recycling in any significant way and by the way please do n't try this technique at home so what are we to do about this space-age material at least what we used to call a space-aged material these plastics well i certainly believe that it 's far too valuable and far too abundant to keep putting back in the ground or certainly send up in smoke so about 20 years ago i literally started in my garage tinkering around trying to figure out how to separate these very similar materials from each other and eventually enlisted a lot of my friends in the mining world actually and in the plastics world and we started going around to mining laboratories around the world because after all we 're doing above-ground mining and we eventually broke the code this is the last frontier of recycling it 's the last major material to be recovered in any significant amount on the earth and we finally figured out how to do it and in the process we started recreating how the plastics industry makes plastics the traditional way to make plastics is with oil or petrochemicals you breakdown the molecules you recombine them in very specific ways to make all the wonderful plastics that we enjoy each and every day we said there 's got to be a more sustainable way to make plastics and not just sustainable from an environmental standpoint sustainable from an economic standpoint as well well a good place to start is with waste it certainly does n't cost as much as oil and it 's plentiful as i hope that you 've been able to see from the photographs and because we 're not breaking down the plastic into molecules and recombining them we 're using a mining approach to extract the materials we have significantly lower capital costs in our plant equipment we have enormous energy savings i do n't know how many other projects on the planet right now can save 80 to 90 percent of the energy compared to making something the traditional way and instead of plopping down several hundred million dollars to build a chemical plant that will only make one type of plastic for its entire life our plants can make any type of plastic we feed them and we make a drop-in replacement for that plastic that 's made from petrochemicals our customers get to enjoy huge co2 savings they get to close the loop with their products and they get to make more sustainable products in the short time period i have i want to show you a little bit of a sense about how we do this it starts with metal recyclers who shred our stuff into very small bits they recover the metals and leave behind what 's called shredder residue [UNK] it 's their waste [UNK] a very complex mixture of materials but predominantly plastics we take out the things that are n't plastics such as the metals they missed carpeting foam rubber wood glass paper you name it even an occasional dead animal unfortunately and it goes in the first part of our process here which is more like traditional recycling we 're sieving the material we 're using magnets we 're using air classification it looks like the willy wonka factory at this point at the end of this process we have a mixed plastic composite many different types of plastics and many different grades of plastics this goes into the more sophisticated part of our process and the really hard work multi-step separation process begins we grind the plastic down to about the size of your small fingernail we use a very highly automated process to sort those plastics not only by type but by grade and out the end of that part of the process come little flakes of plastic one type one grade we then use optical sorting to color sort this material we blend it in 50,000-lb blending silos we push that material to extruders where we melt it push it through small die holes make spaghetti-like plastic strands and we chop those strands into what are called pellets and this becomes the currency of the plastics industry this is the same material that you would get from oil and today we 're producing it from your old stuff and it 's going right back into your new stuff so now instead of your stuff ending up on a hillside in a developing country or literally going up in smoke you can find your old stuff back on top of your desk in new products in your office or back at work in your home and these are just a few examples of companies that are buying our plastic replacing virgin plastic to make their new products so i hope i 've changed the way you look at at least some of the stuff in your life we took our clues from mother nature mother nature wastes very little reuses practically everything and i hope that you stop looking at yourself as a consumer [UNK] that 's a label i 've always hated my entire life [UNK] and think of yourself as just using resources in one form until they can be transformed to another form for another use later in time and finally i hope you agree with me to change that last toddler rule just a little bit to " if it 's broken it 's my stuff " thank you for your time .i 'd like to start with a short story it 's about a little boy whose father was a history buff and who used to take him by the hand to visit the ruins of an ancient metropolis on the outskirts of their camp they would always stop by to visit these huge winged bulls that used to guard the gates of that ancient metropolis and the boy used to be scared of these winged bulls but at the same time they excited him and the dad used to use those bulls to tell the boy stories about that civilization and their work let 's fast-forward to the san francisco bay area many decades later where i started a technology company that brought the world its first 3d laser scanning system let me show you how it works female voice long range laser scanning the system measures the beam 's time of flight recording the time it takes for the light to hit a surface and make its return with two mirrors the scanner calculates the beam 's horizontal and vertical angles giving accurate x y and z coordinates the point is then recorded into a 3d visualization program all of this happens in seconds ben kacyra you can see here these systems are extremely fast they collect millions of points at a time with very high accuracy and very high resolution a surveyor with traditional survey tools would be hard-pressed to produce maybe 500 points in a whole day these babies would be producing something like ten thousand points a second so as you can imagine this was a paradigm shift in the survey and construction as well as in reality capture industry approximately ten years ago my wife and i started a foundation to do good and right about that time the magnificent bamiyan buddhas hundred and eighty foot tall in afghanistan were blown up by the taliban they were gone in an instant and unfortunately there was no detailed documentation of these buddhas this clearly devastated me and i could n't help but wonder about the fate of my old friends the winged bulls and the fate of the many many heritage sites all over the world both my wife and i were so touched by this that we decided to expand the mission of our foundation to include digital heritage preservation of world sites we called the project cyark which stands for cyber archive to date with the help of a global network of partners we 've completed close to fifty projects let me show you some of them chichen itza rapa nui [UNK] and what you 're seeing here are the cloud of points [UNK] babylon rosslyn chapel pompeii and our latest project mt rushmore our most challenging projects as you see here we had to develop a special rig to bring the scanner up close and personal the results of our work in the field are used to produce media and deliverables to be used by conservators and researchers we also produce media for dissemination to the public [UNK] free through the cyark website these would be used for education cultural tourism etc what you 're looking at in here is a 3d viewer that we developed that would allow the display and manipulation of [ the ] cloud of points in real time cutting sections through them and extracting dimensions this happens to be the cloud of points for tikal in here you see a traditional 2d architectural engineering drawing that 's used for preservation and of course we tell the stories through fly-throughs and here this is a fly-through the cloud of points of tikal and here you see it rendered and photo-textured with the photography that we take of the site and so this is not a video this is actual 3d points with two to three millimeter accuracy and of course the data can be used to develop 3d models that are very accurate and very detailed and here you 're looking at a model that 's extracted from the cloud of points for stirling castle it 's used for studies for visualization as well as for education and finally we produce mobile apps that include narrated virtual tools the more i got involved in the heritage field the more it became clear to me that we are losing the sites and the stories faster than we can physically preserve them of course earthquakes and all the natural phenomena [UNK] floods tornadoes etc [UNK] take their toll however what occurred to me was human-caused destruction which was not only causing a significant portion of the destruction but actually it was accelerating this includes arson urban sprawl acid rain not to mention terrorism and wars it was getting more and more apparent that we 're fighting a losing battle we 're losing our sites and the stories and basically we 're losing a piece [UNK] and a significant piece [UNK] of our collective memory imagine us as a human race not knowing where we came from luckily in the last two or three decades digital technologies have been developing that have helped us to develop tools that we 've brought to bear in the digital preservation in our digital preservation war this includes for example the 3d laser scanning systems ever more powerful personal computers 3d graphics high-definition digital photography not to mention the internet because of this accelerated pace of destruction it became clear to us that we needed to challenge ourselves and our partners to accelerate our work and we created a project we call the cyark 500 challenge [UNK] and that is to digitally preserve 500 world heritage sites in five years we do have the technology that 's scaleable and our network of global partners has been expanding and can be expanded at a rapid rate so we 're comfortable that this task can be accomplished however to me the 500 is really just the first 500 in order to sustain our work into the future we use technology centers where we partner with local universities and colleges to take the technology to them whereby they then can help us with digital preservation of their heritage sites and at the same time it gives them the technology to benefit from in the future let me close with another short story two years ago we were approached by a partner of ours to digitally preserve an important heritage site a unesco heritage site in uganda the royal kasubi tombs the work was done successfully in the field and the data was archived and publicly disseminated through the cyark website last march we received very sad news the royal tombs had been destroyed by suspected arson a few days later we received a call " is the data available and can it be used for reconstruction " our answer of course was yes let me leave you with a final thought our heritage is much more than our collective memory [UNK] it 's our collective treasure we owe it to our children our grandchildren and the generations we will never meet to keep it safe and to pass it along thank you thank you thank you thank you well i 'm staying here because we wanted to demonstrate to you the power of this technology and so while i 've been speaking you have been scanned the two wizards that i have that are behind the curtain will help me bring the results on the screen this is all in 3d and of course you can fly through the cloud of points you can look at it from on top from the ceiling you can look from different vantage points but i 'm going to ask doug to zoom in on an individual in the crowd just to show the amount of detail that we can create so you have been digitally preserved in about four minutes i 'd like to thank the wizards here we were very lucky to have two of our partners participate in this the historic scotland and the glasgow school of art i 'd like to also thank personally the efforts of david mitchell who is the director of conservation at historic scotland david and doug pritchard who 's the head of visualization at the glasgow school of art thank you transcript

It's a compelling story told with a fiery passion.description keywordscommunication,global issues,morality,politics,warkeywords talkid395talkid titleSamantha Power on a complicated herotitle transcript i spent the better part of a decade looking at american responses to mass atrocity and genocide and i 'd like to start by sharing with you one moment that to me sums up what there is to know about american and democratic responses to mass atrocity and that moment came on april 21 1994 so 14 years ago almost in the middle of the rwandan genocide in which 800,000 people would be systematically exterminated by the rwandan government and some extremist militia on april 21 in the new york times the paper reported that somewhere between 200,000 and 300,000 people had already been killed in the genocide it was in the paper [UNK] not on the front page it was a lot like the holocaust coverage it was buried in the paper rwanda itself was not seen as newsworthy and amazingly genocide itself was not seen as newsworthy but on april 21 a wonderfully honest moment occurred and that was that an american congresswoman named patricia schroeder from colorado met with a group of journalists and one of the journalists said to her what 's up what 's going on in the u.s. government two to 300,000 people have just been exterminated in the last couple of weeks in rwanda it 's two weeks into the genocide at that time but of course at that time you do n't know how long it 's going to last and the journalist said why is there so little response out of washington why no hearings no denunciations no people getting arrested in front of the rwandan embassy or in front of the white house what 's the deal and she said [UNK] she was so honest [UNK] she said " it 's a great question all i can tell you is that in my congressional office in colorado and my office in washington we 're getting hundreds and hundreds of calls about the endangered ape and gorilla population in rwanda but nobody is calling about the people the phones just are n't ringing about the people " and the reason i give you this moment is there 's a deep truth in it and that truth is or was in the 20th century that while we were beginning to develop endangered species movements we did n't have an endangered people 's movement we had holocaust education in the schools most of us were groomed not only on images of nuclear catastrophe but also on images and knowledge of the holocaust there 's a museum of course on the mall in washington right next to lincoln and jefferson i mean we have owned never again culturally appropriately interestingly and yet the politicization of never again the operationalization of never again had never occurred in the 20th century and that 's what that moment with patricia schroeder i think shows that if we are to bring about an end to the world 's worst atrocities we have to make it such there has to be a role [UNK] there has to be the creation of political noise and political costs in response to massive crimes against humanity and so forth so that was the 20th century now here [UNK] and this will be a relief to you at this point in the afternoon [UNK] there is good news amazing news in the 21st century and that is that almost out of nowhere there has come into being an anti-genocide movement an anti-genocide constituency and one that looks destined in fact to be permanent it grew up in response to the atrocities in darfur it is comprised of students there are something like 300 anti-genocide chapters on college campuses around the country it 's bigger than the anti-apartheid movement there are something like 500 high school chapters devoted to stopping the genocide in darfur evangelicals have joined it jewish groups have joined it " hotel rwanda " watchers have joined it it is a cacophonous movement to call it a movement as with all movements perhaps is a little misleading it 's diverse it 's got a lot of different approaches it 's got all the ups and the downs of movements but it has been amazingly successful in one regard in that it has become it has congealed into this endangered people 's movement that was missing in the 20th century it sees itself such as it is the it as something that will create the impression that there will be political cost there will be a political price to be paid for allowing genocide for not having an heroic imagination for not being an upstander but for being in fact a bystander now because it 's student-driven there 's some amazing things that the movement has done they have launched a divestment campaign that has now convinced i think 55 universities in 22 states to divest their holdings of stocks with regard to companies doing business in sudan they have a 1-800-genocide number [UNK] this is going to sound very kitsch but for those of you who may not be i mean may be apolitical but interested in doing something about genocide you dial 1-800-genocide and you type in your zip code and you do n't even have to know who your congressperson is it will refer you directly to your congressperson to your u.s. senator to your governor where divestment legislation is pending they 've lowered the transaction costs of stopping genocide i think the most innovative thing they 've introduced recently are genocide grades and it takes students to introduce genocide grades so what you now have when a congress is in session is members of congress calling up these 19-year-olds or 24-year-olds and saying i 'm just told i have a d minus on genocide what do i do to get a c i just want to get a c. help me and the students and the others who are part of this incredibly energized base are there to answer that and there 's always something to do now what this movement has done is it has extracted from the bush administration from the united states at a time of massive over-stretch [UNK] military financial diplomatic [UNK] a whole series of commitments to darfur that no other country in the world is making for instance the referral of the crimes in darfur to the international criminal court which the bush administration does n't like the expenditure of 3 billion dollars in refugee camps to try to keep basically the people who 've been displaced from their homes by the sudanese government by the so-called janjaweed the militia to keep those people alive until something more durable can be achieved and recently or now not that recently about six months ago the authorization of a peacekeeping force of 26,000 that will go and that 's all the bush administration 's leadership and it 's all because of this bottom-up pressure and the fact that the phones have n't stopped ringing from the beginning of this crisis the bad news however to this question of will evil prevail is that evil lives on the people in those camps are surrounded on all sides by so-called janjaweed these men on horseback with spears and kalashnikovs women who go to get firewood in order to heat the humanitarian aid in order to feed their families [UNK] humanitarian aid the dirty secret of it is it has to be heated really to be edible [UNK] are themselves subjected to rape which is a tool of the genocide that is being used and the peacekeepers i 've mentioned the force has been authorized but almost no country on earth has stepped forward since the authorization to actually put its troops or its police in harm 's way so we have achieved an awful lot relative to the 20th century and yet far too little relative to the gravity of the crime that is unfolding as we sit here as we speak why the limits to the movement why is what has been achieved or what the movement has done been necessary but not sufficient to the crime i think there are a couple [UNK] there are many reasons [UNK] but a couple just to focus on briefly the first is that the movement such as it is stops at america 's borders it is not a global movement it does not have too many compatriots abroad who themselves are asking their governments to do more to stop genocide and the holocaust culture that we have in this country makes americans sort of more prone to i think want to bring never again to life the guilt that the clinton administration expressed that bill clinton expressed over rwanda created a space in our society for a consensus that rwanda was bad and wrong and we wish we had done more and that is something that the movement has taken advantage of european governments for the most part have n't acknowledged responsibility and there 's nothing to kind of to push back and up against so this movement if it 's to be durable and global will have to cross borders and you will have to see other citizens in democracies not simply resting on the assumption that their government would do something in the face of genocide but actually making it such governments will never gravitate towards crimes of this magnitude naturally or eagerly as we saw they have n't even gravitated towards protecting our ports or reigning in loose nukes why would we expect in a bureaucracy that it would orient itself towards distant suffering so one reason is it has n't gone global the second is of course that at this time in particular in america 's history we have a credibility problem a legitimacy problem in international institutions it is structurally really really hard to do as the bush administration rightly does which is to denounce genocide on a monday and then describe water boarding on a tuesday as a no-brainer and then turn up on wednesday and look for troop commitments now other countries have their own reasons for not wanting to get involved let me be clear they 're in some ways using the bush administration as an alibi but it is essential for us to be a leader in this sphere of course to restore our standing and our leadership in the world the recovery 's going to take some time we have to ask ourselves what now what do we do going forward as a country and as citizens in relationship to the world 's worst places the world 's worst suffering killers and the kinds of killers that could come home to roost sometime in the future the place that i turned to answer that question was to a man that many of you may not have ever heard of and that is a brazilian named sergio vieira de mello who as chris said was blown up in iraq in 2003 he was the victim of the first-ever suicide bomb in iraq it 's hard to remember but there was actually a time in the summer of 2003 even after the u.s. invasion where apart from looting civilians were relatively safe in iraq now who was sergio sergio vieira de mello was his name in addition to being brazilian he was described to me before i met him in 1994 as someone who was a cross between james bond on the one hand and bobby kennedy on the other and in the u.n. you do n't get that many people who actually manage to merge those qualities he was james bond-like in that he was ingenious he was drawn to the flames he chased the flames he was like a moth to the flames something of an adrenalin junkie he was successful with women he was bobby kennedy-like because in some ways one could never tell if he was a realist masquerading as an idealist or an idealist masquerading as a realist as people always wondered about bobby kennedy and john kennedy in that way what he was was a decathlete of nation-building of problem-solving of troubleshooting in the world 's worst places and in the world 's most broken places in failing states genocidal states under-governed states precisely the kinds of places that threats to this country exist on the horizon and precisely the kinds of places where most of the world 's suffering tends to get concentrated these are the places he was drawn to he moved with the headlines he was in the u.n. for 34 years he joined at the age of 21 started off when the causes in the wars du jour in the '70s were wars of independence and decolonization he was there in bangladesh dealing with the outflow of millions of refugees [UNK] the largest refugee flow in history up to that point he was in sudan when the civil war broke out there he was in cyprus right after the turkish invasion he was in mozambique for the war of independence he was in lebanon amazingly he was in lebanon [UNK] the u.n. base was used [UNK] palestinians staged attacks out from behind the u.n. base israel then invaded and overran the u.n. base sergio was in beirut when the u.s. embassy was hit by the first-ever suicide attack against the united states people date the beginning of this new era to 911 but surely 1983 with the attack on the us embassy and the marine barracks [UNK] which sergio witnessed [UNK] those are in fact in some ways the dawning of the era that we find ourselves in today from lebanon he went to bosnia in the '90s the issues were of course ethnic sectarian violence he was the first person to negotiate with the khmer rouge talk about evil prevailing i mean here he was in the room with the embodiment of evil in cambodia he negotiates with the serbs he actually crosses so far into this realm of talking to evil and trying to convince evil that it does n't need to prevail that he earns the nickname [UNK] not sergio but serbio while he 's living in the balkans and conducting these kinds of negotiations he then goes to rwanda and to congo in the aftermath of the genocide and he 's the guy who has to decide [UNK] huh ok the genocide is over 800,000 people have been killed the people responsible are fleeing into neighboring countries [UNK] into congo into tanzania i 'm sergio i 'm a humanitarian and i want to feed those [UNK] well i do n't want to feed the killers but i want to feed the two million people who are with them so we 're going to go we 're going to set up camps and we 're going to supply humanitarian aid but uh-oh the killers are within the camps well i 'd like to separate the sheep from the wolves let me go door-to-door to the international community and see if anybody will give me police or troops to do the separation and their response of course was no more than we wanted to stop the genocide and put our troops in harm 's way to do that nor do we now want to get in the way and pluck genocidaires from camps so then you have to make the decision do you turn off the international spigot of life support and risk two million civilian lives or do you continue feeding the civilians knowing that the genocidaires are in the camps literally sharpening their knives for future battle what do you do it 's all lesser-evil terrain in these broken places late '90s nation-building is the cause du jour he 's the guy put in charge he 's the paul bremer or the jerry bremer of first kosovo and then east timor he governs the places he 's the viceroy he has to decide on tax policy on currency on border patrol on policing he has to make all these judgments he 's a brazilian in these places he speaks seven languages he 's been up to that point in 14 war zones so he 's positioned to make better judgments perhaps than people who have never done that kind of work but nonetheless he is the cutting edge of our experimentation with doing good with very few resources being brought to bear in again the world 's worst places and then after timor 911 has happened he 's named u.n. human rights commissioner and he has to balance liberty and security and figure out what do you do when the most powerful country in the united nations is bowing out of the geneva conventions bowing out of international law do you denounce well if you denounce you 're probably never going to get back in the room maybe you stay reticent maybe you try to charm president bush [UNK] and that 's what he did and in so doing he earned himself unfortunately his final and tragic appointment to iraq [UNK] the one that resulted in his death one note on his death which is so devastating is that despite predicating the war on iraq on a link between saddam hussein and terrorism in 911 believe it or not the bush administration or the invaders did no planning no pre-war planning to respond to terrorism so sergio [UNK] this receptacle of all of this learning on how to deal with evil and how to deal with brokenness lay under the rubble for three and a half hours without rescue stateless the guy who tried to help the stateless people his whole career like a refugee because he represents the u.n if you represent everyone in some ways you represent no one you 're un-owned and what the american [UNK] the most powerful military in the history of mankind was able to muster for his rescue believe it or not was literally these heroic two american soldiers went into the shaft building was shaking one of them had been at 911 and lost his buddies on september 11th and yet went in and risked his life in order to save sergio but all they had was a woman 's handbag [UNK] literally one of those basket handbags [UNK] and they tied it to a curtain rope from one of the offices at u.n. headquarters and created a pulley system into this shaft in this quivering building in the interests of rescuing this person the person we most need to turn to now this shepherd at a time when so many of us feel like we 're lacking guidance and this was the pulley system this was what we were able to muster for sergio the good news for what it 's worth is after sergio and 21 others were killed that day in the attack on the u.n. the military created a search and rescue unit that had the cutting equipment the shoring wood the cranes the things that you would have needed to do the rescue but it was too late for sergio i want to wrap up but i want to close with what i take to be the four lessons from sergio 's life on this question of how do we prevent evil from prevailing which is how i would have framed the question here 's this guy who got a 34-year head start thinking about the kinds of questions we as a country are grappling with we as citizens are grappling with now what do we take away first i think is his relationship to in fact evil is something to learn from he over the course of his career changed a great deal he had a lot of flaws but he was very adaptive i think that was his greatest quality he started as somebody who would denounce harmdoers he would charge up to people who were violating international law and he would say you 're violating this is the u.n. charter do n't you see it 's unacceptable what you 're doing and they would laugh at him because he did n't have the power of states the power of any military or police he just had the rules he had the norms and he tried to use them and in lebanon southern lebanon in '82 he said to himself and to everybody else i will never use the word " unacceptable " again i will never use it i will try to make it such but i will never use that word again but he lunged in the opposite direction he started as i mentioned to get in the room with evil to not denounce and became almost obsequious when he won the nickname serbio for instance and even when he negotiated with the khmer rouge would black-box what had occurred prior to entering the room but by the end of his life i think he had struck a balance that we as a country can learn from be in the room do n't be afraid of talking to your adversaries but do n't bracket what happened before you entered the room do n't black-box history do n't check your principles at the door and i think that 's something that we have to be in the room whether it 's nixon going to china or khrushchev and kennedy or reagan and gorbachev all the great progress in this country with relation to our adversaries has come by going into the room and it does n't have to be an act of weakness you can actually do far more to build an international coalition against a harmdoer or a wrongdoer by being in the room and showing to the rest of the world that that person that regime is the problem and that you the united states are not the problem second take-away from sergio 's life briefly what i take away and this in some ways is the most important he espoused and exhibited a reverence for dignity that was really really unusual at a micro level the individuals around him were visible he saw them at a macro level he thought you know we talk about democracy promotion but we do it in a way sometimes that 's an affront to people 's dignity we put people on humanitarian aid and we boast about it because we 've spent three billion it 's incredibly important those people would no longer be alive if the united states for instance had n't spent that money in darfur but it 's not a way to live if we think about dignity in our conduct as citizens and as individuals with relation to the people around us and as a country if we could inject a regard for dignity into our dealings with other countries it would be something of a revolution third point very briefly he talked a lot about freedom from fear and i recognize there is so much to be afraid of there are so many genuine threats in the world but what sergio was talking about is let 's calibrate our relationship to the threat let 's not hype the threat let 's actually see it clearly we have reason to be afraid of melting ice caps we have reason to be afraid that we have n't secured loose nuclear material in the former soviet union let 's focus on what are the legitimate challenges and threats but not lunge into bad decisions because of a panic of a fear in times of fear for instance one of the things sergio used to say is fear is a bad advisor we lunge towards the extremes when we are n't operating and trying to again calibrate our relationship to the world around us fourth and final point he somehow because he was working in all the world 's worst places and all lesser evils had a humility of course and an awareness of the complexity of the world around him i mean such an acute awareness of how hard it was how sisyphean this task was of mending and yet aware of that complexity humbled by it he was n't paralyzed by it and we as citizens as we go through this experience of the kind of the crisis of confidence crisis of competence crisis of legitimacy i think there 's a temptation to pull back from the world and say ah katrina iraq [UNK] we do n't know what we 're doing we ca n't afford to pull back from the world it 's a question of how to be in the world and the lesson i think of the anti-genocide movement that i mentioned that is a partial success but by no means has it achieved what it has set out to do [UNK] it 'll be many decades probably before that happens [UNK] but is that if we want to see change we have to become the change we ca n't rely upon our institutions to do the work of necessarily talking to adversaries on their own without us creating a space for that to happen for having respect for dignity and for bringing that combination of humility and a sort of emboldened sense of responsibility to our dealings with the rest of the world so will evil prevail is that the question i think the short answer is no not unless we let it thank you .i 'm a writer and a journalist and i 'm also an insanely curious person so in 22 years as a journalist i 've learned how to do a lot of new things and three years ago one of the things i learned how to do was to become invisible i became one of the working homeless i quit my job as a newspaper editor after my father died in february of that same year and decided to travel his death hit me pretty hard and there were a lot of things that i wanted to feel and deal with while i was doing that i 've camped my whole life and i decided that living in a van for a year to do this would be like one long camping trip so i packed my cat my rottweiler and my camping gear into a 1975 chevy van and drove off into the sunset having fully failed to realize three critical things one that society equates living in a permanent structure even a shack with having value as a person two i failed to realize how quickly the negative perceptions of other people can impact our reality if we let it three i failed to realize that homelessness is an attitude not a lifestyle at first living in the van was great i showered in campgrounds i ate out regularly and i had time to relax and to grieve but then the anger and the depression about my father 's death set in my freelance job ended and i had to get a full-time job to pay the bills what had been a really mild spring turned into a miserably hot summer and it became impossible to park anywhere [UNK] [UNK] without being very obvious that i had a cat and a dog with me and it was really hot the cat came and went through an open window in the van the doggy went into doggy day care and i sweated whenever i could i used employee showers in office buildings and truck stops or i washed up in public rest rooms nighttime temperatures in the van rarely dropped below 80 degrees fahrenheit making it difficult or impossible to sleep food rotted in the heat ice in my ice chest melted within hours and it was pretty miserable i could n't afford to find an apartment or could n't afford an apartment that would allow me to have the rottweiler and the cat and i refused to give them up so i stayed in the van and when the heat made me too sick to walk the 50 feet to the public restroom outside my van at night i used a bucket and a trash bag as a toilet when winter weather set in the temperatures dropped below freezing and they stayed there and i faced a whole new set of challenges i parked a different place every night so i would avoid being noticed and hassled by the police i did n't always succeed but i felt out of control of my life and i do n't know when or how it happened but the speed at which i went from being a talented writer and journalist to being a homeless woman living in a van took my breath away i had n't changed my i.q had n't dropped my talent my integrity my values everything about me remained the same but i had changed somehow i spiraled deeper and deeper into a depression and eventually someone referred me to a homeless health clinic and i went i had n't bathed in three days i was as smelly and as depressed as anyone in line i just was n't drunk or high and when several of the homeless men realized that including a former university professor they said " you are n't homeless why are you really here " other homeless people did n't see me as homeless but i did then the professor listened to my story and he said " you have a job you have hope the real homeless do n't have hope " a reaction to the medication the clinic gave me for my depression left me suicidal and i remember thinking " if i killed myself no one would notice " a friend told me shortly after that that she had heard that tim russert a nationally renowned journalist had been talking about me on national t.v an essay i 'd written about my father the year before he died was in tim 's new book and he was doing the talk show circuit and he was talking about my writing and when i realized that tim russert former moderator of " meet the press " was talking about my writing while i was living in a van in a wal-mart parking lot i started laughing you should too i started laughing because it got to the point where was i a writer or was i a homeless woman so i went in the bookstore and i found tim 's book and i stood there and i reread my essay and i cried because i was a writer i was a writer shortly after that i moved back to tennessee i alternated between living in a van and couch surfing with friends and i started writing again by the summer of the following year i was a working journalist i was winning awards i was living in my own apartment i was no longer homeless and i was no longer invisible thousands of people work full and part-time jobs and live in their cars but society continues to stigmatize and criminalize living in your vehicle or on the streets so the homeless the working homeless primarily remain invisible but if you ever meet one engage them encourage them and offer them hope the human spirit can overcome anything if it has hope and i 'm not here to be the poster girl for the homeless i 'm not here to encourage you to give money to the next panhandler you meet but i am here to tell you that based on my experience people are not where they live where they sleep or what their life situation is at any given time three years ago i was living in a van in a wal-mart parking lot and today i 'm speaking at ted hope always always finds a way thank you .do you ever feel completely overwhelmed when you 're faced with a complex problem well i hope to change that in less than three minutes so i hope to convince you that complex does n't always equal complicated so for me a well-crafted baguette fresh out of the oven is complex but a curry onion green olive poppy cheese bread is complicated i 'm an ecologist and i study complexity i love complexity and i study that in the natural world the interconnectedness of species so here 's a food web or a map of feeding links between species that live in alpine lakes in the mountains of california and this is what happens to that food web when it 's stocked with non-native fish that never lived there before all the grayed-out species disappear some are actually on the brink of extinction and lakes with fish have more mosquitoes even though they eat them these effects were all unanticipated and yet we 're discovering they 're predictable so i want to share with you a couple key insights about complexity we 're learning from studying nature that maybe are applicable to other problems first is the simple power of good visualization tools to help untangle complexity and just encourage you to ask questions you did n't think of before for example you could plot the flow of carbon through corporate supply chains in a corporate ecosystem or the interconnections of habitat patches for endangered species in yosemite national park the next thing is that if you want to predict the effect of one species on another if you focus only on that link and then you black box the rest it 's actually less predictable than if you step back consider the entire system [UNK] all the species all the links [UNK] and from that place hone in on the sphere of influence that matters most and we 're discovering with our research that 's often very local to the node you care about within one or two degrees so the more you step back embrace complexity the better chance you have of finding simple answers and it 's often different than the simple answer that you started with so let 's switch gears and look at a really complex problem courtesy of the u.s. government this is a diagram of the u.s. counterinsurgency strategy in afghanistan it was front page of the new york times a couple months ago instantly ridiculed by the media for being so crazy complicated and the stated goal was to increase popular support for the afghan government clearly a complex problem but is it complicated well when i saw this in the front page of the times i thought " great finally something i can relate to i can sink my teeth into this " so let 's do it so here we go for the first time ever a world premiere view of this spaghetti diagram as an ordered network the circled node is the one we 're trying to influence [UNK] popular support for the government and so now we can look one degrees two degrees three degrees away from that node and eliminate three-quarters of the diagram outside that sphere of influence within that sphere most of those nodes are not actionable like the harshness of the terrain and a very small minority are actual military actions most are non-violent and they fall into two broad categories active engagement with ethnic rivalries and religious beliefs and fair transparent economic development and provisioning of services i do n't know about this but this is what i can decipher from this diagram in 24 seconds when you see a diagram like this i do n't want you to be afraid i want you to be excited i want you to be relieved because simple answers may emerge we 're discovering in nature that simplicity often lies on the other side of complexity so for any problem the more you can zoom out and embrace complexity the better chance you have of zooming in on the simple details that matter most thank you .do you remember the story of odysseus and the sirens from high school or junior high school there was this hero odysseus who 's heading back home after the trojan war and he 's standing on the deck of his ship he 's talking to his first mate and he 's saying " tomorrow we will sail past those rocks and on those rocks sit some beautiful women called sirens and these women sing an enchanting song a song so alluring that all sailors who hear it crash into the rocks and die " now you would expect given that that they would choose an alternate route around the sirens but instead odysseus says " i want to hear that song and so what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to pour wax in the ears of you and all the men [UNK] stay with me [UNK] so that you ca n't hear the song and then i 'm going to have you tie me to the mast so that i can listen and we can all sail by unaffected " so this is a captain putting the life of every single person on the ship at risk so that he can hear a song and i 'd like to think if this was the case they probably would have rehearsed it a few times odysseus would have said " okay let 's do a dry run you tie me to the mast and i 'm going to beg and plead and no matter what i say you can not untie me from the mast all right so tie me to the mast " and the first mate takes a rope and ties odysseus to the mast in a nice knot and odysseus does his best job playacting and says " untie me untie me i want to hear that song untie me " and the first mate wisely resists and does n't untie odysseus and then odysseus says " i see that you can get it all right untie me now and we 'll get some dinner " and the first mate hesitates he 's like " is this still the rehearsal or should i untie him " and the first mate thinks " well i guess at some point the rehearsal has to end " so he unties odysseus and odysseus flips out he 's like " you idiot you moron if you do that tomorrow i 'll be dead you 'll be dead every single one of the men will be dead now just do n't untie me no matter what " he throws the first mate to the ground this repeats itself through the night [UNK] rehearsal tying to the mast conning his way out of it beating the poor first mate up mercilessly hilarity ensues tying yourself to a mast is perhaps the oldest written example of what psychologists call a commitment device a commitment device is a decision that you make with a cool head to bind yourself so that you do n't do something regrettable when you have a hot head because there 's two heads inside one person when you think about it scholars have long invoked this metaphor of two selves when it comes to questions of temptation there is first the present self this is like odysseus when he 's hearing the song he just wants to get to the front row he just thinks about the here and now and the immediate gratification but then there 's this other self the future self this is odysseus as an old man who wants nothing more than to retire in a sunny villa with his wife penelope outside of ithaca [UNK] the other one so why do we need commitment devices well resisting temptation is hard as the 19th century english economist nassau william senior said " to abstain from the enjoyment which is in our power or to seek distant rather than immediate results are among the most painful exertions of the human will " if you set goals for yourself and you 're like a lot of other people you probably realize it 's not that your goals are physically impossible that 's keeping you from achieving them it 's that you lack the self-discipline to stick to them it 's physically possible to lose weight it 's physically possible to exercise more but resisting temptation is hard the other reason that it 's difficult to resist temptation is because it 's an unequal battle between the present self and the future self i mean let 's face it the present self is present it 's in control it 's in power right now it has these strong heroic arms that can lift doughnuts into your mouth and the future self is not even around it 's off in the future it 's weak it does n't even have a lawyer present there 's nobody to stick up for the future self and so the present self can trounce all over its dreams so there 's this battle between the two selves that 's being fought and we need commitment devices to level the playing field between the two now i 'm a big fan of commitment devices actually tying yourself to the mast is the oldest one but there are other ones such as locking a credit card away with a key or not bringing junk food into the house so you wo n't eat it or unplugging your internet connection so you can use your computer i was creating commitment devices of my own long before i knew what they were so when i was a starving post-doc at columbia university i was deep in a publish-or-perish phase of my career i had to write five pages a day towards papers or i would have to give up five dollars and when you try to execute these commitment devices you realize the devil is really in the details because it 's not that easy to get rid of five dollars i mean you ca n't burn it that 's illegal and i thought well i could give it to a charity or give it to my wife or something like that but then i thought oh i 'm sending myself mixed messages because not writing is bad but giving to charity is good so then i would kind of justify not writing by giving a gift and then i kind of flipped that around and thought well i could give it to the neo-nazis but then i was like that 's more bad than writing is good and so that would n't work so ultimately i just decided i would leave it in an envelope on the subway sometimes a good person would find it sometimes a bad person would find it on average it was just a completely pointless exchange of money that i would regret such it is with commitment devices but despite my like for them there 's two nagging concerns that i 've always had about commitment devices and you might feel this if you use them yourself so the first is when you 've got one of these devices going such as this contract to write everyday or pay it 's just a constant reminder that you have no self-control you 're just telling yourself " without you commitment device i am nothing i have no self-discipline " and then when you 're ever in a situation where you do n't have a commitment device in place [UNK] like " oh my god that person 's offering me a doughnut and i have no defense mechanism " [UNK] you just eat it so i do n't like the way that they take the power away from you i think self-discipline is something it 's like a muscle the more you exercise it the stronger it gets the other problem with commitment devices is that you can always weasel your way out of them you say " well of course i ca n't write today because i 'm giving a tedtalk and i have five media interviews and then i 'm going to a cocktail party and then i 'll be drunk after that and so there 's no way that this is going to work " so in effect you are like odysseus and the first mate in one person you 're putting yourself you 're binding yourself and you 're weaseling your way out of it and then you 're beating yourself up afterwards so i 've been working for about a decade now on finding other ways to change people 's relationship to the future self without using commitment devices in particular i 'm interested in the relationship to the future financial self and this is a timely issue i 'm talking about the topic of saving now saving is a classic two selves problem the present self does not want to save at all it wants to consume whereas the future self wants the present self to save so this is a timely problem we look at the savings rate and it has been declining since the 1950s at the same time the retirement risk index the chance of not being able to meet your needs in retirement has been increasing and we 're at a situation now where for every three baby boomers the mckinsey global institute predicts that two will not be able to meet their pre-retirement needs while they 're in retirement so what can we do about this there 's a philosopher derek parfit who said some words that were inspiring to my coauthors and i he said that " we might neglect our future selves because of some failure of belief or imagination " that is to say we somehow might not believe that we 're going to get old or we might not be able to imagine that we 're going to get old some day on the one hand it sounds ridiculous of course we know that we 're going to get old but are n't there things that we believe and do n't believe at the same time so my coauthors and i have used computers the greatest tool of our time to assist people 's imagination and help them imagine what it might be like to go into the future and i 'll show you some of these tools right here the first is called the distribution builder it shows people what the future might be like by showing them a hundred equally probable outcomes that might be obtained in the future each outcome is shown by one of these markers and each sits on a row that represents a level of wealth and retirement being up at the top means that you 're enjoying a high income in retirement being down at the bottom means that you 're struggling to make ends meet when you make an investment what you 're really saying is " i accept that any one of these 100 things could happen to me and determine my wealth " now you can try to move your outcomes around you can try to manipulate your fate like this person is doing but it costs you something to do it it means that you have to save more today once you find an investment that you 're happy with what people do is they click " done " and the markers begin to disappear slowly one by one it simulates what it is like to invest in something and to watch that investment pan out at the end there will only be one marker left standing and it will determine our wealth in retirement yes this person retired at 150 percent of their working income in retirement they 're making more money while retired than they were making while they were working if you 're like most people just seeing that gave you a small sense of elation and joy [UNK] just to think about making 50 percent more money in retirement than before however had you ended up on the very bottom it might have given you a slight sense of dread andor nausea thinking about struggling to get by in retirement by using this tool over and over and simulating outcome after outcome people can understand that the investments and savings that they undertake today determine their well-being in the future now people are motivated through emotions but different people find different things motivating this is a simulation that uses graphics but other people find motivating what money can buy not just numbers so here i made a distribution builder where instead of showing numerical outcomes i show people what those outcomes will get you in particular apartments that you can afford if you 're retiring on 3,000 2,500 2,000 dollars per month and so on as you move down the ladder of apartments you see that they get worse and worse some of them look like places i lived in as a graduate student and as you get to the very bottom you 're faced with the unfortunate reality that if you do n't save anything for retirement you wo n't be able to afford any housing at all those are actual pictures of actual apartments renting for that amount as advertised on the internet the last thing i 'll show you the last behavioral time machine is something that i created with hal hershfield who was introduced to me by my coauthor on a previous project bill sharpe and what it is is an exploration into virtual reality so what we do is we take pictures of people [UNK] in this case college-age people [UNK] and we use software to age them and show these people what they 'll look like when they 're 60 70 80 years old and we try to test whether actually assisting your imagination by looking at the face of your future self can change you investment behavior so this is one of our experiments here we see the face of the young subject on the left he 's given a control that allows him to adjust his savings rate as he moves his savings rate down it means that he 's saving zero when it 's all the way here at the left you can see his current annual income [UNK] this is the percentage of his paycheck that he can take home today [UNK] is quite high 91 percent but his retirement income is quite low he 's going to retire on 44 percent of what he earned while he was working if he saves the maximum legal amount his retirement income goes up but he 's unhappy because now he has less money on the left-hand side to spend today other conditions show people the future self and from the future self 's point of view everything is in reverse if you save very little the future self is unhappy living on 44 percent of the income whereas if the present self saves a lot the future self is delighted where the income is close up near 100 percent to bring this to a wider audience i 've been working with hal and allianz to create something we call the behavioral time machine in which you not only get to see yourself in the future but you get to see anticipated emotional reactions to different levels of retirement wealth so for instance here is somebody using the tool and just watch the facial expressions as they move the slider the younger face gets happier and happier saving nothing the older face is miserable and slowly slowly we 're bringing it up to a moderate savings rate and then it 's a high savings rate the younger face is getting unhappy the older face is quite pleased with the decision we 're going to see if this has an effect on what people do and what 's nice about it is it 's not something that biasing people actually because as one face smiles the other face frowns it 's not telling you which way to put the slider it 's just reminding you that you are connected to and legally tied to this future self your decisions today are going to determine its well-being and that 's something that 's easy to forget this use of virtual reality is not just good for making people look older there are programs you can get to see how people might look if they smoke if they get too much exposure to the sun if they gain weight and so on and what 's good is unlike in the experiments that hal and myself ran with russ smith you do n't have to program these by yourself in order to see the virtual reality there are applications you can get on smartphones for just a few dollars that do the same thing this is actually a picture of hal my coauthor you might recognize him from the previous demos and just for kicks we ran his picture through the balding aging and weight gain software to see how he would look hal is here so i think we owe it to him as well as yourself to disabuse you of that last image and i 'll close it there on behalf of hal and myself i wish all the best to your present and future selves thank you .i 'm going to tell you two things today one is what we have lost and two a way to bring it back and let me start with this this is my baseline this is the mediterranean coast with no fish bare rock and lots of sea urchins that like to eat the algae something like this is what i first saw when i jumped in the water for the first time in the mediterranean coast off spain now if an alien came to earth [UNK] let 's call him joe [UNK] what would joe see if joe jumped in a coral reef there are many things the alien could see very unlikely joe would jump on a pristine coral reef a virgin coral reef with lots of coral sharks crocodiles manatees groupers turtles etc so probably what joe would see would be in this part in the greenish part of the picture here we have the extreme with dead corals microbial soup and jellyfish and where the diver is this is probably where most of the reefs of the world are now with very few corals algae overgrowing the corals lots of bacteria and where the large animals are gone and this is what most marine scientists have seen too this is their baseline this is what they think is natural because we started modern science with scuba diving long after we started degrading marine ecosystems so i 'm going to get us all on a time machine and we 're going to the left we 're going to go back to the past to see what the ocean was like and let 's start with this time machine the line islands where we have conducted a series of national geographic expeditions this sea is an archipelago belonging to kiribati that spans across the equator and it has several uninhabited unfished pristine islands and a few inhabited islands so let 's start with the first one christmas island over 5,000 people most of the reefs are dead most of the corals are dead [UNK] overgrown by algae [UNK] and most of the fish are smaller than the pencils we use to count them we did 250 hours of diving here in 2005 we did n't see a single shark this is the place that captain cook discovered in 1777 and he described a huge abundance of sharks biting the rudders and the oars of their small boats while they were going ashore let 's move the dial a little bit to the past fanning island 2,500 people the corals are doing better here lots of small fish this is what many divers would consider paradise this is where you can see most of the florida keys national marine sanctuary and many people think this is really really beautiful if this is your baseline if we go back to a place like palmyra atoll where i was with jeremy jackson a few years ago the corals are doing better and there are sharks you can see sharks in every single dive and this is something that is very unusual in today 's coral reefs but then if we shift the dial 200 500 years back then we get to the places where the corals are absolutely healthy and gorgeous forming spectacular structures and where the predators are the most conspicuous thing where you see between 25 and 50 sharks per dive what have we learned from these places this is what we thought was natural this is what we call the biomass pyramid if we get all of the fish of a coral reef together and weigh them this is what we would expect most of the biomass is low on the food chain the herbivores the parrotfish the surgeonfish that eat the algae then the plankton feeders these little damselfish the little animals floating in the water and then we have a lower biomass of carnivores and a lower biomass of top head or the sharks the large snappers the large groupers but this is a consequence this view of the world is a consequence of having studied degraded reefs when we went to pristine reefs we realized that the natural world was upside down this pyramid was inverted the top head does account for most of the biomass in some places up to 85 percent like kingman reef which is now protected the good news is that in addition to having more predators there 's more of everything the size of these boxes is bigger we have more sharks more biomass of snappers more biomass of herbivores too like these parrot fish that are like marine goats they clean the reef everything that grows enough to be seen they eat and they keep the reef clean and allow the corals to replenish not only do these places [UNK] these ancient pristine places [UNK] have lots of fish but they also have other important components of the ecosystem like the giant clams pavements of giant clams in the lagoons up to 20 25 per square meter these have disappeared from every inhabited reef in the world and they filter the water they keep the water clean from microbes and pathogens but still now we have global warming if we do n't have fishing because these reefs are protected by law or their remoteness this is great but the water gets warmer for too long and the corals die so how are these fish these predators going to help well what we have seen is that in this particular area during el nino year '97 '98 the water was too warm for too long and many corals bleached and many died in christmas where the food web is really trimmed down where the large animals are gone the corals have not recovered in fanning island the corals are not recovered but you see here a big table coral that died and collapsed and the fish have grazed the algae so the turf of algae is a little lower then you go to palmyra atoll that has more biomass of herbivores and the dead corals are clean and the corals are coming back and when you go to the pristine side did this ever bleach these places bleached too but they recovered faster the more intact the more complete [ and ] the more complex your food web the higher the resilience [ and ] the more likely that the system is going to recover from the short-term impacts of warming events and that 's good news so we need to recover that structure we need to make sure that all of the pieces of the ecosystem are there so the ecosystem can adapt to the effects of global warming so if we have to reset the baseline if we have to push the ecosystem back to the left how can we do it well there are several ways one very clear way is the marine protected areas especially no-take reserves that we set aside to allow for the recovery for marine life and let me go back to that image of the mediterranean this was my baseline this is what i saw when i was a kid and at the same time i was watching jacques cousteau 's shows on tv with all this richness and abundance and diversity and i thought that this richness belonged to tropical seas and that the mediterranean was a naturally poor sea but little did i know until i jumped for the first time in a marine reserve and this is what i saw lots of fish after a few years between five and seven years fish come back they eat the urchins and then the algae grow again so you have this little algal forest and in the size of a laptop you can find more than 100 species of algae mostly microscopic fit hundreds of species of little animals that then feed the fish so that the system recovers and this particular place the medes islands marine reserve is only 94 hectares and it brings 6 million euros to the local economy 20 times more than fishing and it represents 88 percent of all the tourist revenue so these places not only help the ecosystem but also help the people who can benefit from the ecosystem so let me just give you a summary of what no-take reserves do these places when we protect them if we compare them to unprotected areas nearby this is what happens the number of species increases 21 percent so if you have 1,000 species you would expect 200 more in a marine reserve this is very substantial the size of organisms increases a third so your fish are now this big the abundance how many fish you have per square meter increases almost 170 percent and the biomass [UNK] this is the most spectacular change [UNK] 4.5 times greater biomass on average just after five to seven years in some places up to 10 times larger biomass inside the reserves so we have all these things inside the reserve that grow and what do they do they reproduce that 's population biology 101 if you do n't kill the fish they take a longer time to die they grow larger and they reproduce a lot and same thing for invertebrates this is the example these are egg cases laid by a snail off the coast of chile and this is how many eggs they lay on the bottom outside the reserve you can not even detect this one point three million eggs per square meter inside the marine reserve where these snails are very abundant so these organisms reproduce the little larvae juveniles spill over they all spill over and then people can benefit from them outside too this is in the bahamas nassau grouper huge abundance of groupers inside the reserve and the closer you get to the reserve the more fish you have so the fishermen are catching more you can see where the limits of the reserve are because you see the boats lined up so there is spill over there are benefits beyond the boundaries of these reserves that help people around them while at the same time the reserve is protecting the entire habitat it is building resilience so what we have now [UNK] or a world without reserves [UNK] is like a debit account where we withdraw all the time and we never make any deposit reserves are like savings accounts we have this principal that we do n't touch that produces returns social economic and ecological and if we think about the increase of biomass inside the reserves this is like compound interest two examples again of how these reserves can benefit people this is how much fishermen get everyday in kenya fishing over a series of years in a place where there is no protection it 's a free-for-all once the most degrading fishing gear seine nets were removed the fishermen were catching more if you fish less you 're actually catching more but if we add the no-take reserve on top of that the fishermen are still making more money by fishing less around an area that is protected another example nassau groupers in belize in the mesoamerican reef this is grouper sex and the groupers aggregate around the full moons of december and january for a week they used to aggregate up to the tens of thousands 30,000 groupers about this big in one hectare in one aggregation fishermen knew about these things they caught them and they depleted them when i went there for the first time in 2000 there were only 3,000 groupers left and the fishermen were authorized to catch 30 percent of the entire spawning population every year so we did a simple analysis and it does n't take rocket science to figure out that if you take 30 percent every year your fishery is going to collapse very quickly and with the fishery the entire reproductive ability of the species goes extinct it happened in many places around the caribbean and they would make 4,000 dollars per year total for the entire fishery several fishing boats now if you do an economic analysis and project what would happen if the fish were not cut if we brought just 20 divers one month per year the revenue would be more than 20 times higher and that would be sustainable over time so how much of this do we have if this is so good if this is such a no-brainer how much of this do we have and you already heard that less than one percent of the ocean 's protected we 're getting closer to one percent now thanks to the protections of the chagos archipelago and only a fraction of this is fully protected from fishing scientific studies recommend that at least 20 percent of the ocean should be protected the estimated range is between 20 and 50 percent for a series of goals of biodiversity and fishery enhancement and resilience now is this possible people would ask how much would that cost well let 's think about how much we are paying now to subsidize fishing 35 billion dollars per year many of these subsidies go to destructive fishing practices well there are a couple estimates of how much it would cost to create a network of protected areas covering 20 percent of the ocean that would be only a fraction of what we are now paying the government hands out to a fishery that is collapsing people are losing their jobs because the fisheries are collapsing a creation of a network of reserves would provide direct employment for more than a million people plus all the secondary jobs and all the secondary benefits so how can we do that if it 's so clear that these savings accounts are good for the environment and for people why do n't we have 20 50 percent of the ocean and how can we reach that goal well there are two ways of getting there the trivial solution is to create really large protected areas like the chagos archipelago the problem is that we can create these large reserves only in places where there are no people where there is no social conflict where the political cost is really low and the economic cost is also low and a few of us a few organizations in this room and elsewhere are working on this but what about the rest of the coast of the world where people live and make a living out of fishing well there are three main reasons why we do n't have tens of thousands of small reserves the first one is that people have no idea what marine reserves do and fishermen tend to be really really defensive when it comes to regulating or closing an area even if it 's small second the governance is not right because most coastal communities around the world do n't have the authority to monitor the resources to create the reserve and enforce it it 's a top down hierarchical structure where people wait for government agents to come and this is not effective and the government does n't have enough resources which takes us to the third reason why we do n't have many more reserves is that the funding models have been wrong ngos and governments spend a lot of time and energy and resources in a few small areas usually so marine conservation and coastal protection has become a sink for government or philanthropic money and this is not sustainable so the solutions are just fixing these three issues first we need to develop a global awareness campaign to inspire local communities and governments to create no-take reserves that are better than what we have now it 's the savings accounts versus the debit accounts with no deposits second we need to redesign our governance so conservation efforts can be decentralized so conservation efforts do n't depend on work from ngos or from government agencies and can be created by the local communities like it happens in the philippines and a few other places and third and very important we need to develop new business models the philanthropy sink as the only way to create reserves is not sustainable we really need to develop models business models where coastal conservation is an investment because we already know that these marine reserves provide social ecological and economic benefits and i 'd like to finish with one thought which is that no one organization alone is going to save the ocean there has been a lot of competition in the past and we need to develop a new model of partnership truly collaborative where we are looking for complementing not substituting the stakes are just too high to continue the way we are going so let 's do that thank you very much chris anderson thank you enric enric sala thank you ca that was a masterful job of pulling things together first of all your pyramid your inverted pyramid showing 85 percent biomass in the predators that seems impossible how could 85 percent survive on 15 percent es well imagine that you have two gears of a watch a big one and a small one the big one is moving very slowly and the small one is moving fast that 's basically it the animals at the lower parts of the food chain they reproduce very fast they grow really fast they produce millions of eggs up there you have sharks and large fish that live 25 30 years they reproduce very slowly they have a slow metabolism and basically they just maintain their biomass so basically the production surplus of these guys down there is enough to maintain this biomass that is not moving they are like capacitors of the system ca that 's very fascinating so really our picture of a food pyramid is just [UNK] we have to change that completely es at least in the seas what we found in coral reefs is that the inverted pyramid is the equivalent of the serengeti with five lions per wildebeest and on land this can not work but at least on coral reefs are systems where there is a bottom component with structure we think this is universal but we have started studying pristine reefs only very recently ca so the numbers you presented really are astonishing you 're saying we 're spending 35 billion dollars now on subsidies it would only cost 16 billion to set up 20 percent of the ocean as marine protected areas that actually give new living choices to the fishermen as well if the world was a smarter place we could solve this problem for negative 19 billion dollars we 've got 19 billion to spend on health care or something es and then we have the under-performance of fisheries that is 50 billion dollars so again one of the big solutions is have the world trade organization shifting the subsidies to sustainable practices ca okay so there 's a lot of examples that i 'm hearing out there about ending this subsidies madness so thank you for those numbers the last one 's a personal question a lot of the experience of people here who 've been in the oceans for a long time has just been seeing this degradation the places they saw that were beautiful getting worse depressing talk to me about the feeling that you must have experienced of going to these pristine areas and seeing things coming back es it is a spiritual experience we go there to try to understand the ecosystems to try to measure or count fish and sharks and see how these places are different from the places we know but the best feeling is this biophilia that e.o wilson talks about where humans have this sense of awe and wonder in front of untamed nature of raw nature and there only there you really feel that you are part of a larger thing or of a larger global ecosystem and if it were not for these places that show hope i do n't think i could continue doing this job it would be just too depressing ca well enric thank you so much for sharing some of that spiritual experience with us all thank you es thank you very much .this is really a two-hour presentation i give to high school students cut down to three minutes and it all started one day on a plane on my way to ted seven years ago and in the seat next to me was a high school student a teenager and she came from a really poor family and she wanted to make something of her life and she asked me a simple little question she said " what leads to success " and i felt really badly because i could n't give her a good answer so i get off the plane and i come to ted and i think jeez i 'm in the middle of a room of successful people 1 so why do n't i ask them what helped them succeed and pass it on to kids so here we are seven years 500 interviews later and i 'm gon na tell you what really leads to success and makes ted-sters tick and the first thing is passion freeman thomas says " i 'm driven by my passion " ted-sters do it for love they do n't do it for money carol coletta says " i would pay someone to do what i do " and the interesting thing is if you do it for love the money comes anyway work 1 rupert murdoch said to me " it 's all hard work nothing comes easily but i have a lot of fun " did he say fun rupert yes 1 ted-sters do have fun working and they work hard i figured they 're not workaholics they 're workafrolics good 1 alex garden says " to be successful put your nose down in something and get damn good at it " there 's no magic it 's practice practice practice and it 's focus norman jewison said to me " i think it all has to do with focusing yourself on one thing " and push 1 david gallo says " push yourself physically mentally you 've got ta push push push " you got ta push through shyness and self-doubt goldie hawn says " i always had self-doubts i was n't good enough i was n't smart enough i did n't think i 'd make it " now it 's not always easy to push yourself and that 's why they invented mothers frank gehry [UNK] frank gehry said to me " my mother pushed me " serve 1 sherwin nuland says " it was a privilege to serve as a doctor " now a lot of kids tell me they want to be millionaires and the first thing i say to them is " ok well you ca n't serve yourself you got ta serve others something of value because that 's the way people really get rich " ideas 1 ted-ster bill gates says " i had an idea founding the first micro-computer software company " i 'd say it was a pretty good idea and there 's no magic to creativity in coming up with ideas [UNK] it 's just doing some very simple things and i give lots of evidence persist 1 joe kraus says " persistence is the number one reason for our success " you got ta persist through failure you got ta persist through crap 1 which of course means " criticism rejection assholes and pressure " so the big [UNK] the answer to this question is simple pay 4,000 bucks and come to ted or failing that do the eight things [UNK] and trust me these are the big eight things that lead to success thank you ted-sters for all your interviews !you 'll be happy to know that i 'll be talking not about my own tragedy but other people 's tragedy it 's a lot easier to be lighthearted about other people 's tragedy than your own and i want to keep it in the spirit of the conference so if you believe the media accounts being a drug dealer in the height of the crack cocaine epidemic was a very glamorous life in the words of virginia postrel there was money there was drugs guns women you know you name it [UNK] jewelry bling-bling [UNK] it had it all what i 'm going to tell you today is that in fact based on 10 years of research a unique opportunity to go inside a gang [UNK] to see the actual books the financial records of the gang [UNK] that the answer turns out not to be that being in the gang was a glamorous life but i think more realistically that being in a gang [UNK] selling drugs for a gang [UNK] is perhaps the worst job in all of america and that 's what i 'd like to convince you of today so there are three things i want to do first i want to explain how and why crack cocaine had such a profound influence on inner-city gangs secondly i want to tell you how somebody like me came to be able to see the inner workings of a gang it 's an interesting story i think and then third i want to tell you in a very superficial way about some of the things we found when we actually got to look at the financial records [UNK] the books [UNK] of the gang so before i do that just one warning which is that this presentation has been rated 'r ' by the motion picture association of america it contains adult themes adult language given who is up on the stage you 'll be delighted to know that in fact there 'll be no nudity barring a [UNK] [UNK] unexpected wardrobe malfunctions aside so let me start by talking about crack cocaine and how it transformed the gang and to do that you have to actually go back to a time before crack cocaine in the early '80s and look at it from the perspective of a gang leader so being a gang leader in the inner city was n't such a bad deal in the mid-'80s in the early '80s some would say now you had a lot of power and you got to beat people up [UNK] you got a lot of prestige a lot of respect but there was no money in it ok the gang had no way to make money and you could n't charge dues to the people in the gang because the people in the gang did n't have any money you could n't really make any money selling marijuana marijuana 's too cheap it turns out you ca n't get rich selling marijuana you could n't sell cocaine you know cocaine 's a great product [UNK] powdered cocaine [UNK] but you 've got to know rich white people and most of the inner-city gang members did n't know any rich white people [UNK] they could n't sell to that market you could n't really do petty crime either it turns out petty crime 's a terrible way to make a living so as a result as a gang leader you had you know power [UNK] it 's a pretty good life [UNK] but the thing was in the end you were living at home with your mother and so it was n't really a career it was something that [UNK] it 's just there were limits to how powerful and important you could be if you had to live at home with your mother then along comes crack cocaine and in the words of malcolm gladwell crack cocaine was the extra-chunky version of tomato sauce for the inner city because crack cocaine was an unbelievable innovation i do n't have time to talk about it today but if you think about it i would say that in the last twenty-five years of every invention or innovation that 's occurred in this country the biggest one in terms of impact on the well-being of people who live in the inner city was crack cocaine and for the worse [UNK] not for the better but for the worse it had a huge impact on life so what was it about crack cocaine it was a brilliant way of getting the brain high because you could smoke crack cocaine [UNK] you ca n't smoke powdered cocaine [UNK] and smoking is a much more efficient mechanism at delivering a high than is snorting it and it turned out there was this audience that did n't know it wanted crack cocaine but when it came it really did and it was a perfect drug you could sell for [UNK] buy the cocaine that went into it for a dollar sell it for five dollars highly addictive [UNK] the high was very short so for fifteen minutes you get this great high and then when you come down all you want to do is get high again it created a wonderful market and for the people who were there running the gang it was a great way seemingly to make a lot of money at least for the people in the top so this is where we enter the picture not really me [UNK] i 'm really a bit player in all this my co-author sudhir venkatesh is the main character so he was a math major in college who had a good heart and decided he wanted to get a sociology ph.d. came to the university of chicago now the three months before he came to chicago he had spent following the grateful dead and in his own words he " looked like a freak " he 's a south asian [UNK] very dark-skinned south asian big man and he had hair in his words " down to his ass " defied all kinds of boundaries was he black or white was he man or woman he was really a curious sight to be seen so he showed up at the university of chicago and the famous sociologist william julius wilson was doing a book that involved surveying people all across chicago and he took one look at sudhir who was going to go do some surveys for him and decided he knew exactly the place to send him [UNK] which was to one of the toughest most notorious housing projects and not just in chicago but in the entire united states so sudhir [UNK] the suburban boy who had never really been in the inner city [UNK] dutifully took his clipboard and you know walked down to this housing project gets to the first building the first building well there 's nobody there but he hears some voices up in the stairwell so he climbs up the stairwell and he comes around the corner [UNK] finds a group of young african-american men playing dice this is about 1990 [UNK] peak of the crack epidemic this is a very dangerous job being in a gang [UNK] you do n't like to be surprised you do n't like to be surprised by people who come around the corner and the mantra was shoot first ask questions later now sudhir was lucky he was such a freak [UNK] and that clipboard probably saved his life because they figured no other rival gang member would be coming up to shoot at them with a clipboard so his greeting was not particularly warm but they did say well ok [UNK] let 's hear your questions on your survey so i kid you not the first question on the survey that he was sent to ask was " how do you feel about being poor and black in america " makes you wonder about academics ok so the choice of answers were very good good bad and very bad what sudhir found out is in fact that the real answer was the following [UNK] the survey was not in the end going to be what got sudhir off the hook he was held hostage overnight in the stairwell there was a lot of gunfire there were a lot of philosophical discussions he had with the gang members by morning the gang leader arrived checked out sudhir decided he was no threat and they let him go home so sudhir went home took a shower took a nap and you and i probably faced with the situation would think well i guess i 'm going to write my dissertation on the grateful dead i 've been following them for the last three months sudhir on the other hand got right back [UNK] walked down to the housing project went up to the floor the second floor and said " hey guys i had so much fun hanging out with you last night i wonder if i could do it again tonight " and that was the beginning of what turned out to be a beautiful relationship that involved sudhir living in the housing project on and off for 10 years hanging out in crack houses going to jail with the gang members having the car-windows shot out of his car having the police break into his apartment and steal his computer disks [UNK] you name it but ultimately the story has a happy ending for sudhir who became one of the most respected sociologists in the country and especially for me as i sat in my office with my excel spreadsheet open waiting for sudhir to come and deliver to me the latest load of data that he would get from the gang it was one of the most unequal co-authoring relationships ever [UNK] [UNK] but i was glad to be the beneficiary of it so what do we find what do we find in the gang well let me say one thing we really got access to everybody in the gang we got an inside look at the gang from the very bottom up to the very top they trusted sudhir [UNK] in ways that really no academic has ever [UNK] or really anybody any outsider [UNK] has ever earned the trust of these gangs to the point where they actually opened up what was most interesting for me their books their financial records that they kept and they made them available to us and we not only could study them but we could ask them questions about what was in them so if i have to kind of summarize very quickly in the short time i have what the sort of bottom line of what i take away from the gang is is that if i had to draw a parallel between the gang and any other organization it would be that the gang is just like mcdonald 's in a lot of different respects [UNK] the restaurant mcdonald 's so first in one way [UNK] which is n't maybe the most interesting way but it 's a good way to start [UNK] is in the way it 's organized [UNK] the hierarchy of the gang the way it looks so here 's what the org chart of the gang looks like i do n't know if any of you know very much about org charts but if you were to assign a stripped-down and simplified mcdonald 's org chart this is exactly what the org chart would look like now it 's amazing but the top level of the gang they actually call themselves the " board of directors " and sudhir says it 's not like these guys had a very sophisticated kind of view of like what happened in american corporate life but they had seen movies like " wall street " and they kind of had learned a little bit about what it was like to be in the real world now below that board of directors you 've got essentially what are regional vps [UNK] people who control say the south side of chicago or the west side of chicago now sudhir got to know very well the guy who had the unfortunate assignment of trying to take the iowa franchise which it turned out for this black gang was not one of the more brilliant financial endeavors that they undertook but the thing that really makes the gang seem like mcdonald 's is its franchisees that the guys who are running you know the local gangs [UNK] they 're just like the guys in some sense who are running the mcdonald 's they are the entrepreneurs they get the exclusive property rights to control the drug-selling they get the name of the gang behind them for merchandising and marketing and they 're the ones who basically make the profit or lose a profit depending on how good they are at running the business now the group i really want you to think about though are the ones at the bottom the foot soldiers these are the teenagers typically who 'd be standing out on the street corner selling the drugs extremely dangerous work and important to note that almost all of the weight all of the people in this organization are at the bottom ok just like mcdonald 's so in some sense the foot soldiers are a lot like the people who are taking your order at mcdonald 's and indeed it 's not just by chance that they 're like them in fact in these neighborhoods they 'd be the same people so the same kids who are working in the gang were actually [UNK] at the very same time they would typically be working part-time at a place like mcdonald 's which already i think foreshadows the main result that i 've talked about about what a crappy job it was being in the gang because obviously if being in the gang were such a wonderful lucrative job why in the world would these guys moonlight at mcdonald 's so what do the wages look like so you might be surprised but based on the actual [UNK] you know being able to talk to them and to see their records this is what it looks like in terms of the wages the hourly wage the foot soldiers were earning was $ 3.50 in an hour it was below the minimum wage ok and this is well documented it 's easy to see by the patterns of consumption they have it really is not fiction [UNK] it 's fact there was very little money in the gang especially at the bottom now if you managed to rise up [UNK] say and be that local leader the guy who 's the equivalent of the mcdonald 's franchisee [UNK] you 'd be making 100,000 dollars a year and that in some ways was the best job you could hope to get if you were growing up in one of these neighborhoods as a young black male if you managed to rise to the very top 200,000 or 400,000 dollars a year is what you 'd hope to make truly you would be a great success story and one of the sad parts of this is that indeed among the many other ramifications of crack cocaine is that the most talented individuals in these communities [UNK] this is what they were striving for they were n't trying to make it in legitimate ways because there were no legitimate channels out this was the best way out and it actually was the right choice probably to try to make it out [UNK] this way you look at this [UNK] the relationship to mcdonald 's breaks down here the money looks about the same why is it such a bad job well the reason it 's such a bad job is that there 's somebody shooting at you a lot of the time so with shooting at you what are the death rates we found in our gang [UNK] and admittedly this was not really sort of a standard situation this was a time of intense violence [UNK] of a lot of gang wars [UNK] as this gang actually became quite successful but there were costs and so the death rate [UNK] not to mention the rate of being arrested sent to prison being wounded [UNK] the death rate in our sample was seven percent per person per year you 're in the gang for four years you expect to die with about a 25 percent likelihood so for comparison 's purposes let 's think about some other walk of life where you may expect might be extremely risky like let 's say that you were a murderer and you were convicted of murder and you 're sent to death row it turns out the death rates on death row [UNK] from all causes including execution [UNK] two percent a year so it 's a lot safer being on death row than it is selling drugs out on the street that makes you pause [UNK] gives you some pause [UNK] those of you who believe that a death penalty 's going to have an enormous deterrent effect on crime now to give you a sense of just how bad the inner city was during crack [UNK] and i 'm not really focusing on the negatives but really there 's another story to tell you there [UNK] if you look at the death rates [UNK] just of random young black males growing up in the inner city in the united states [UNK] the death rates during crack were about one percent that 's extremely high and this is violent death [UNK] it 's unbelievable in some sense to put it into perspective if you compare this to the soldiers in iraq for instance right now fighting the war 0.5 percent so in some very literal way the young black men who were growing up in this country were living in a war zone very much in the sense of the way that the soldiers over in iraq are fighting in a war so why in the world you might ask would anybody be willing to stand out on a street corner selling drugs for $ 3.50 an hour with a 25 percent chance of dying over the next four years why would they do that and i think there are a couple answers i think the first one is that they got fooled by history it used to be the gang was a rite of passage that the young people controlled the gang [UNK] that as you got older you dropped out of the gang so what happened was the people who happened to be in the right place at the right time [UNK] the people who happened to be leading the gang in the mid- to late '80s [UNK] became very very wealthy and so the logical thing to think was that " well the next generation [UNK] so they 're going to age out of the gang like everybody else has and the next generation is going to take over and get the wealth " so there are striking similarities i think to the internet boom right the first set of people in silicon valley got very very rich and then all of my friends said " maybe i should go do that too " and they were willing to work very cheap for stock options that never came in some sense that 's what happened exactly to the set of people we were looking at is that they were willing to start at the bottom just like say a lawyer at a law firm [UNK] a first-year lawyer is wiling to start at the bottom work 80-hour weeks for not that much money because they think they 're going to make partner but what happened was the rules changed and they never got to make partner indeed the same people who were running all of the major gangs in the late 1980s are still running the major gangs in chicago today they never passed on any of the wealth so everybody got stuck at that $ 3.50-an-hour job and it turned out to be a disaster the other thing the gang was very very good at was marketing and trickery and so for instance one thing the gang would do is [UNK] you know the gang leaders would have big entourages and they 'd drive fancy cars and have fancy jewelry so what sudhir eventually realized as he hung out with them more is that really they did n't own those cars they just leased them [UNK] because they could n't afford to own the fancy cars and they did n't really have gold jewelry [UNK] they had gold-plated jewelry it goes back to you know the real-real versus the fake-real and really they did all sorts of things to trick the young people into thinking what a great deal the gang was going to be so for instance they would give a 14-year-old kid [UNK] they 'd give him a whole you know roll of bills to hold that 14-year-old kid would say " oh well 1 " you know he would say to his friends " hey look at all the money i got in the gang " it was n't his money until he spent it and then essentially he was in debt to the gang and was sort of an indentured servant for a while so i have a couple minutes let me do one last thing i had n't thought i 'd have time to do which is to talk about what we learned more generally about economics from the study of the gang so economists tend to talk in technical words often our theories fail quite miserably when we go to the data but actually what 's kind of interesting is that in this setting it turned out that some of the economic theories that worked not so well in the real economy worked very well in the drug economy [UNK] in some sense because it 's unfettered capitalism here 's an economic principle this is one of the basic ideas in labor economics called a " compensating differential " it 's the idea that basically the increment to wages that a worker requires to leave him indifferent between performing two tasks [UNK] one which is more unpleasant than the other [UNK] that 's what you call a " compensating differential " it 's why we think garbage men might be paid more than people who work in parks ok so in the words of one of the members of the gang i think makes this clear so it turns out [UNK] i 'm sort of getting ahead of myself it turns out in the gang when there 's a war going on that they actually pay the foot soldiers twice as much money it 's exactly this concept because they 're not willing to be at risk and the words of a gang member capture it quite nicely he says " would you stand around here when all this shit " [UNK] that means shooting [UNK] " if all this shit 's going on no right so if i going to be asked to put my life on the line then front me the cash man " so essentially i think the gang member says it much more articulately than does the economist about what 's going on here 's another one so economists talk about game theory [UNK] that every two-person game has a nash equilibrium here 's the translation you get from the gang member they 're talking about the decision of why they do n't go shoot [UNK] one thing that turns out to be a great business tactic in the gang if you go and just shoot in the air [UNK] just shoot guns in the other gang 's territory [UNK] all the people are afraid to go buy their drugs there they 're going to come into your neighborhood but here 's what he says about why they do n't do that he says " if we start shooting around there " [UNK] in the other gang 's territory [UNK] " nobody and i mean you dig it nobody going to step on their turf but we got ta be careful because they can shoot around here too and then we all fucked " so that 's exactly the same concept but then again sometimes economists get it wrong so one thing we observed in the data is that it looked like in terms of 1 the gang leader always got paid ok no matter how bad it was economically he always got himself paid so we had some theories related to cash flow and lack of access to capital markets and things like that but then we asked the gang member " well why is it you always get paid and your workers do n't always get paid " his response is " you got all these niggers below you who want your job you dig if you start taking losses they see you as weak and shit " and i thought about it and i said " ceos often pay themselves million-dollar bonuses even when companies are losing a lot of money and it never would really occur to an economist that this idea of 'weak and shit ' could really be important " but maybe [UNK] maybe " weak and shit " [UNK] maybe " weak and shit " is an important hypothesis that needs more analysis thank you very much .everyone please think of your biggest personal goal for real [UNK] you can take a second you 've got to feel this to learn it take a few seconds and think of your personal biggest goal okay imagine deciding right now that you 're going to do it imagine telling someone that you meet today what you 're going to do imagine their congratulations and their high image of you does n't it feel good to say it out loud do n't you feel one step closer already like it 's already becoming part of your identity well bad news you should have kept your mouth shut because that good feeling now will make you less likely to do it repeated psychology tests have proven that telling someone your goal makes it less likely to happen any time you have a goal there are some steps that need to be done some work that needs to be done in order to achieve it ideally you would not be satisfied until you had actually done the work but when you tell someone your goal and they acknowledge it psychologists have found that it 's called a " social reality " the mind is kind of tricked into feeling that it 's already done and then because you felt that satisfaction you 're less motivated to do the actual hard work necessary so this goes against the conventional wisdom that we should tell our friends our goals right [UNK] so they hold us to it so let 's look at the proof 1926 kurt lewin founder of social psychology called this " substitution " 1933 vera mahler found when it was acknowledged by others it felt real in the mind 1982 peter gollwitzer wrote a whole book about this and in 2009 he did some new tests that were published it goes like this 163 people across four separate tests [UNK] everyone wrote down their personal goal then half of them announced their commitment to this goal to the room and half did n't then everyone was given 45 minutes of work that would directly lead them towards their goal but they were told that they could stop at any time now those who kept their mouths shut worked the entire 45 minutes on average and when asked afterwards said that they felt that they had a long way to go still to achieve their goal but those who had announced it quit after only 33 minutes on average and when asked afterwards said that they felt much closer to achieving their goal so if this is true what can we do well you could resist the temptation to announce your goal you can delay the gratification that the social acknowledgement brings and you can understand that your mind mistakes the talking for the doing but if you do need to talk about something you can state it in a way that gives you no satisfaction such as " i really want to run this marathon so i need to train five times a week and kick my ass if i do n't okay " so audience next time you 're tempted to tell someone your goal what will you say exactly well done .so there are a few things that bring us humans together in the way that an election does we stand in elections we vote in elections we observe elections our democracies rely on elections we all understand why we have elections and we all leave the house on the same day to go and vote we cherish the opportunity to have our say to help decide the future of the country the fundamental idea is that politicians are given mandate to speak for us to make decisions on our behalf that affect us all without that mandate they would be corrupt well unfortunately power corrupts and so people will do lots of things to get power and to stay in power including doing bad things to elections you see even if the idea of the election is perfect running a countrywide election is a big project and big projects are messy whenever there is an election it seems like something always goes wrong someone tries to cheat or something goes accidentally awry [UNK] a ballot box goes missing here chads are left hanging over here to make sure as few things as possible go wrong we have all these procedures around the election so for example you come to the polling station and a poll station worker asks for your id before giving you a ballot form and asking you to go into a voting booth to fill out your vote when you come back out you get to drop your vote into the ballot box where it mixes with all the other votes so that no one knows how you voted well what i want us to think about for a moment is what happens after that after you drop your vote into the ballot box and most people would go home and feel sure that their vote has been counted because they trust that the election system works they trust that election workers and election observers do their jobs and do their jobs correctly the ballot boxes go to counting places they 're unsealed and the votes are poured out and laboriously counted most of us have to trust that that happens correctly for our own vote and we all have to trust that that happens correctly for all the votes in the election so we have to trust a lot of people we have to trust a lot of procedures and sometimes we even have to trust computers so imagine hundreds of millions of voters casting hundreds of millions of votes all to be counted correctly and all the things that can possibly go wrong causing all these bad headlines and you can not help but feel exhausted at the idea of trying to make elections better well in the face of all these bad headlines researchers have taken a step back and thought about how we can do elections differently they 've zoomed out and looked at the big picture and the big picture is this elections should be verifiable voters should be able to check that their votes are counted correctly without breaking election secrecy which is so very important and that 's the tough part how do we make an election system completely verifiable while keeping the votes absolutely secret well the way we 've come up with uses computers but does n't depend on them and the secret is the ballot form and if you look closely at these ballot forms you 'll notice that the candidate list is in a different order on each one and that means if you mark your choices on one of them and then remove the candidate list i wo n't be able to tell from the bit remaining what your vote is for and on each ballot form there is this encrypted value in the form of this 2d barcode on the right and there 's some complicated cryptography going on in there but what 's not complicated is voting with one of these forms so we can let computers do all the complicated cryptography for us and then we 'll use the paper for verification so this is how you vote you get one of these ballot forms at random and then you go into the voting booth and you mark your choices and you tear along a perforation and you shred the candidate list and the bit that remains the one with your marks [UNK] this is your encrypted vote so you let a poll station worker scan your encrypted vote and because it 's encrypted it can be submitted stored and counted centrally and displayed on a website for anyone to see including you so you take this encrypted vote home as your receipt and after the close of the election you can check that your vote was counted by comparing your receipt to the vote on the website and remember the vote is encrypted from the moment you leave the voting booth so if an election official wants to find out how you voted they will not be able to if the government wants to find out how you voted they wo n't be able to no hacker can break in and find out how you voted no hacker can break in and change your vote because then it wo n't match your receipt votes ca n't go missing because then you wo n't find yours when you look for it but the election magic does n't stop there instead we want to make the whole process so transparent that news media and international observers and anyone who wants to can download all the election data and do the count themselves they can check that all the votes were counted correctly they can check that the announced result of the election is the correct one and these are elections by the people for the people so the next step for our democracies are transparent and verifiable elections thank you .i am going to speak about corruption but i would like to juxtapose two different things one is the large global economy the large globalized economy and the other one is the small and very limited capacity of our traditional governments and their international institutions to govern to shape this economy because there is this asymmetry which creates basically failing governance failing governance in many areas in the area of corruption and the area of destruction of the environment in the area of exploitation of women and children in the area of climate change in all the areas in which we really need a capacity to reintroduce the primacy of politics into the economy which is operating in a worldwide arena and i think corruption and the fight against corruption and the impact of corruption is probably one of the most interesting ways to illustrate what i mean with this failure of governance let me talk about my own experience i used to work as the director of the world bank office in nairobi for east africa at that time i noticed that corruption that grand corruption that systematic corruption was undermining everything we were trying to do and therefore i began to not only try to protect the work of the world bank our own projects our own programs against corruption but in general i thought " we need a system to protect the people in this part of the world from the ravages of corruption " and as soon as i started this work i received a memorandum from the world bank from the legal department first in which they said " you are not allowed to do this you are meddling in the internal affairs of our partner countries this is forbidden by the charter of the world bank so i want you to stop your doings " in the meantime i was chairing donor meetings for instance in which the various donors and many of them like to be in nairobi [UNK] it is true it is one of the unsafest cities of the world but they like to be there because the other cities are even less comfortable and in these donor meetings i noticed that many of the worst projects [UNK] which were put forward by our clients by the governments by promoters many of them representing suppliers from the north [UNK] that the worst projects were realized first let me give you an example a huge power project 300 million dollars to be built smack into one of the most vulnerable and one of the most beautiful areas of western kenya and we all noticed immediately that this project had no economic benefits it had no clients nobody would buy the electricity there nobody was interested in irrigation projects to the contrary we knew that this project would destroy the environment it would destroy riparian forests which were the basis for the survival of nomadic groups the samburu and the turkana in this area so everybody knew this is a not a useless project this is an absolute damaging a terrible project [UNK] not to speak about the future indebtedness of the country for these hundreds of millions of dollars and the siphoning off of the scarce resources of the economy from much more important activities like schools like hospitals and so on and yet we all rejected this project none of the donors was willing to have their name connected with it and it was the first project to be implemented the good projects which we as a donor community would take under our wings they took years you know you had too many studies and very often they did n't succeed but these bad projects which were absolutely damaging [UNK] for the economy for many generations for the environment for thousands of families who had to be resettled [UNK] they were suddenly put together by consortia of banks of supplier agencies of insurance agencies [UNK] like in germany hermes and so on [UNK] and they came back very very quickly driven by an unholy alliance between the powerful elites in the countries there and the suppliers from the north now these suppliers were our big companies they were the actors of this global market which i mentioned in the beginning they were the siemenses of this world coming from france from the uk from japan from canada from germany and they were systematically driven by systematic large-scale corruption we are not talking about 50,000 dollars here or 100,000 dollars there or one million dollars there no we are talking about 10 million 20 million dollars on the swiss bank accounts on the bank accounts of liechtenstein of the president 's ministers the high officials in the para-statal sectors this was the reality which i saw and not only one project like that i saw i would say over the years i worked in africa i saw hundreds of projects like this and so i became convinced that it is this systematic corruption which is perverting economic policy-making in these countries which is the main reason for the misery for the poverty for the conflicts for the violence for the desperation in many of these countries that we have today more than a billion people below the absolute poverty line that we have more than a billion people without proper drinking water in the world twice that number more than two billion people without sanitation and so on and the consequent illnesses of mothers and children still child mortality of more than 10 million people every year children dying before they are five years old the cause of this is to a large extent grand corruption now why did the world bank not let me do this work i found out afterwards after i left under a big fight the world bank the reason was that the members of the world bank thought that foreign bribery was okay including germany in germany foreign bribery was allowed it was even tax-deductible no wonder that most of the most important international operators in germany but also in france and the uk and scandinavia everywhere systematically bribed not all of them but most of them and this is the phenomenon which i call failing governance because when i then came to germany and started this little ngo here in berlin at the villa borsig we were told " you can not stop our german exporters from bribing because we will lose our contracts we will lose to the french we will lose to the swedes we 'll lose to the japanese " and therefore there was a indeed a prisoner 's dilemma which made it very difficult for an individual company an individual exporting country to say " we are not going to continue this deadly disastrous habit of large companies to bribe " so this is what i mean with a failing governance structure because even the powerful government which we have in germany comparatively was not able to say " we will not allow our companies to bribe abroad " they needed help and the large companies themselves have this dilemma many of them did n't want to bribe many of the german companies for instance believe that they are really producing a high-quality product at a good price so they are very competitive they are not as good at bribing as many of their international competitors are but they were not allowed to show their strengths because the world was eaten up by grand corruption and this is why i 'm telling you this civil society rose to the occasion we had this small ngo transparency international they began to think of an escape route from this prisoner 's dilemma and we developed concepts of collective action basically trying to bring various competitors together around the table explaining to all of them how much it would be in their interests if they simultaneously would stop bribing and to make a long story short we managed to eventually get germany to sign together with the other oecd countries and a few other exporters in 1997 a convention under the auspices of the oecd which obliged everybody to change their laws and criminalize foreign bribery well thank you i mean it 's interesting in doing this we had to sit together with the companies we had here in berlin at the aspen institute on the wannsee we had sessions with about 20 captains of industry and we discussed with them what to do about international bribery in the first session [UNK] we had three sessions over the course of two years and president von weizsäcker by the way chaired one of the sessions the first one to take the fear away from the entrepreneurs who were not used to deal with non-governmental organizations and in the first session they all said " this is not bribery what we are doing " this is customary there this is what these other cultures demand they even applaud it in fact [ unclear ] still says this today and so there are still a lot of people who are not convinced that you have to stop bribing but in the second session they admitted already that they would never do this what they are doing in these other countries here in germany or in the u.k. and so on cabinet ministers would admit this and in the final session at the aspen institute we had them all sign an open letter to the kohl government at the time requesting that they participate in the oecd convention and this is in my opinion an example of soft power because we were able to convince them that they had to go with us we had a longer-term time perspective we had a broader geographically much wider constituency we were trying to defend and that 's why the law has changed that 's why siemens is now in the trouble they are in and that 's why min is in the trouble they are in in some other countries the oecd convention is not yet properly enforced and again civil societies breathing down the neck of the establishment in london for instance where the bae got away with a huge corruption case which the serious fraud office tried to prosecute 100 million british pounds every year for ten years to one particular official of one particular friendly country who then bought for 44 billion pounds of military equipment this case they are not prosecuting in the uk why because they consider this as contrary to the security interest of the people of great britain civil society is pushing civil society is trying to get a solution to this problem also in the u.k. and also in japan which is not properly enforcing and so on in germany we are pushing the ratification of the un convention which is a subsequent convention we are germany is not ratifying why because it would make it necessary to criminalize the corruption of deputies in germany we have a system where you are not allowed to bribe a civil servant but you are allowed to bribe a deputy this is under german law allowed and the members of our parliament do n't want to change this and this is why they ca n't sign the u.n. convention against foreign bribery [UNK] one of they very very few countries which is preaching honesty and good governance everywhere in the world but not able to ratify the convention which we managed to get on the books with about 160 countries all over the world i see my time is ticking let me just try to draw some conclusions from what has happened i believe that what we managed to achieve in fighting corruption one can also achieve in other areas of failing governance by now the united nations is totally on our side the world bank has turned from saulus to paulus under wolfensohn they became i would say the strongest anti-corruption agency in the world most of the large companies are now totally convinced that they have to put in place very strong policies against bribery and so on and this is possible because civil society joined the companies and joined the government in the analysis of the problem in the development of remedies in the implementation of reforms and then later in the monitoring of reforms of course if civil society organizations want to play that role they have to grow into this responsibility not all civil society organizations are good the ku klux klan is an ngo so we must be aware that civil society has to shape up itself they have to have a much more transparent financial governance they have to have a much more participatory governance in many civil society organizations we also need much more competence of civil society leaders this is why we have set up the governance school and the center for civil society here in berlin because we believe most of our educational and research institutions in germany and continental europe in general do not focus enough yet on empowering civil society and training the leadership of civil society but what i 'm saying from my very practical experience if civil society does it right and joins the other actors [UNK] in particular governments governments and their international institutions but also large international actors in particular those which have committed themselves to corporate social responsibility [UNK] then in this magical triangle between civil society government and private sector there is a tremendous chance for all of us to create a better world thank you .[ shit ] this is arguably the back end of the design of animals but the reason i put this up here is because when i was in africa last year my wife and i were driving around we had this wonderful guide who showed us something that surprised both of us and it was very revealing in terms of the fascination that comes with the design of animals it turns out that in about the 1880s the missionaries came to africa to spread the word of christianity to teach english to the natives and they brought blackboards and chalk and i 'd like you to imagine that that 's a blackboard and i just used some chalk on there and they brought quite a bit of this stuff but over the years the blackboards were fine but they ran out of chalk and this is a real crisis for them and that 's where the hyena comes in the hyena is probably the most perfectly designed scavenging animal in the world it strip-mines carcasses and it has amazing teeth because it enables the hyena to essentially eat bones now the end product of that action is up on the board here and what the missionaries would do is they 'd walk around and they 'd pick up hyena shit and the incredible thing about hyena shit is it makes great chalk now that 's not what i 'm here to talk about but it is a fascinating aspect of animal design what i 'm here to talk about is the camel when i started talking to richard about what i was going to speak about i had recently come back from jordan where i had an amazing experience with a camel and we were in the desert [UNK] richard wurman that 's the end of this talk 1 keith bellows yeah yeah we were in the desert in wadi rum in a small jeep there were four of us [UNK] two bedouin drivers [UNK] and you can just imagine this expanse is an ocean of sand 105 degrees one water bottle and we were driving in what they told us was their very very best jeep did n't look like it to me and as we started to go through the desert the jeep broke down the guys got out they put the hood up they started working under the hood got it going again about a hundred yards it broke down this went on about six or seven times and we were getting more and more alarmed and we were also getting deeper and deeper into the desert and eventually our worst nightmare happened they flooded the engine and they said " ah no problem 1 we just get out and walk " and we said " we get out and walk " one water bottle [UNK] remember guys [UNK] four people and they said " yeah yeah we 'll walk we 'll find some camels " so we got out and walked and sure enough about half a mile we came over the crest of this hill and there was a huge gathering of bedouin with their camels the guy went up and started dickering and 10 dollars later we had four camels they went down like elevators we got on them they went back up and the bedouin [UNK] each bedouin four of them [UNK] got behind each of the camels with a little whip and they started slashing away at the back of the camels and they started galloping and if you 've ever been on a camel it is a very very uncomfortable ride there 's also one other aspect about these camels about every 10 steps they lean back and try to take a chunk out of your leg so we kept on going and this camel kept on trying to take a chunk out of my leg and eventually three miles later we arrived at our destination where a jeep was supposed to meet us and the camels come down again like elevators we sort of clumsily get off and they [UNK] obviously [UNK] try to take another chunk out of my leg and i 've developed a very wonderful relationship with this creature by this point and i 've realized that this is a mean son of a bitch and much meaner by the way than the bedouin who greeted me and tried to sell me one of his 26 daughters to take back to the states so as we talked richard and i i said " you know maybe i should bring a camel i think the camel is the best designed animal in the world " and he kind of went " nah i do n't think we want to be bringing a camel " and you should be really glad we decided not to bring the camel so i did the next best thing i went to the washington zoo richard said " i want you to get up close and personal with this camel i want you to inspect its mouth look at its teeth go underneath it go above it go around it pull its tail up take a look in there i want you to get as close to that camel as you possibly can " so i got a national geographic film crew we went down there and i took one look at this camel it is a 2,000 pound creature who is in rut now if you 've ever seen a 2,000 pound camel in a rut it is a scary scary thing to behold and if richard thought i was getting in the ring with that camel someone was smoking bedouin high grade so we got as close to it as possible and i 'm going to share this [UNK] chris if you want to roll this film [UNK] and then i 'm going to show you a little bit more about the design of camels do you want to roll the film hello this is keith bellows with the national geographic camel investigation unit i 'm here to look at the ultimate desert machine and you 'll note i started chewing gum because i was around this camel all day senior keeper that 's it that 's it ok. no 1 see now he 's getting a little overexcited so we 'll need to be very careful around him do n't let him get you now you can see copious amounts of saliva in there [ unclear ] i call myself the unstable stable boy their nose [UNK] you can see his nose is flared right now when they 're in rut [UNK] they 're similar to seals in the way like a seal has to open its nose to breathe and they 're similar they have to kind of consciously open their nose ears they are small but they have excellent hearing but not a big [UNK] for instance in zebras they have a huge ear that 's very mobile so they can actually turn them both around and they use them in the same way we use our binocular vision they use them to pinpoint sound the desert 's extremely windy as well as being very cold so not only do they have the very long eyelashes but there 's the secondary [UNK] i guess you 'd call it the [ unclear ] or whatever it 's this hair that 's above the eyes and below it it 's longer most people think that the humps store water they do n't they store fat but [UNK] now i 'm not a chemist but basically what happens is the fat is oxidized by their breathing and that will turn it into actually usable water like a lot of predators they walk on their toes but there 's a big fat pad in there that squishes out they 're like sun shoes but you know with sand hooves they do n't have traditional hooves but they do have one like big nail you ca n't really see too clear the fur 's kind of grown over but they use their tails a lot especially in rut he will urinate and spin his tail to spread the urine around and make him more attractive i do n't know why that would be but it works for them so what the hell now they will also defecate in certain areas generally they poop wherever they want to but during their rut they will defecate in perimeter areas i do n't know if you 've read or heard about the sub-sonic sounds from elephants [UNK] you know what i mean like " br-r-r 1 " these big big rumbling sounds he will do the same thing you can actually see right here it will vibrate we weigh our animals unfortunately he 's a very aggressive animal so he 's actually destroyed some of the scales we had these big things that i weigh the bison on for instance i 'm guessing that he [UNK] well he 's at least 1,600 pounds he 's basically a walking mulch pile we 're kind of like buds but i 'm also a male as well and he 's [UNK] kb he sees you as competition senior keeper yeah exactly and it makes him very dangerous at this time of year do n't even think about it do n't think about it 1 but now we 're going to meet [UNK] out 1 out 1 out 1 no out 1 kb what i did n't show you was [UNK] you got that swinging thing going well [UNK] and you 're glad i did n't show you this one of the other things about the camel 's beautiful design is that its penis points backwards that way the camel can dip its tail in the stream and just whacker the entire area around him and that 's how he really marks his territory now what you also did n't see was that [UNK] and you may have noticed in the pen beside him and by the way the camel 's name is suki in the pen beside him is jasmine jasmine has been his mate for some time but on this particular occasion it was very very clear that as horny as suki was jasmine was having none of it and so we started thinking well if poor old suki is in search of a mate what would suki do to find the perfect mate so i 'm going to show you another film but before i do i just want to mention that this animal truly is a sort of the suv of the sand the ship of the desert it 's so vital to the inhabitants of the areas in which the camel is found [UNK] largely mongolia and sahara [UNK] that there are 160 words in arabic to describe the camel and if this is a creature that was designed by committee it 's certainly been like no committee i 've ever been on so here 's what suki would do in search of a mate can you roll it please camel seeking camel lusty beast desires attractive & amp sincere mate i 'm seven ft. 2,000 lbs. with brown haireyes long legs 1 and i 'm very well 1 hung i 'm ted camel the perfect desert machine i 'm smartly designed eyelashes that keep out sand and a third eyelash that works like a windshield wiper a distinguished nose with nostrils lined to filter out sand and dust and a groove that catches moisture amazingly full lips that allow me to eat practically anything that grows callouses on my knees that let me kneel comfortably leathery chest pads that beat the heat short fur that keeps my skin cool long legs that allow heat to escape and my hump ogden nash once wrote " the camel has a single hump the dromedary two or else the other way around i 'm never sure are you " here 's a hint bactarian dromedary my hump contains up to 80 lbs of fat [UNK] but does n't store h2o i 'm built to last i 'm the go-to animal when the oasis is dry i usually wo n't sweat until my body reaches 105 degrees f [UNK] enough to fry an egg i 'm able to lose 40 percent of my weight without dying i 'll drink five to seven gallons of water a day but go without for more than a month i 'm powerful able to pack up to 400 lbs of cargo outrun a horse and cover 26 miles on a good day camelot jackie o. once said that traveling by camel made riding an elephant seem like taking a jet plane yet my large soft feet allow me to navigate sand i 'm a good provider too bedouins call the camel the gift of god no surprise tents and rugs are made of my hair my dried bones are prized as a sort of ivory my dung is burned as fuel my milk is used for cheese " camels are like angels " a bedouin once said thank you i just want to leave you with one last thought which is probably the most important thing to take away humans [UNK] the animal [UNK] are pretty lucky creatures because by and large we really do n't have to adapt to our environment we adapt our environment to us and we 've seen that repeatedly through this conference [UNK] not just this year but in past years but this creature that you 've just seen ultimately adapts and keeps adapting and adapting and i think when you look at the animal kingdom that is one of the most remarkable things it does n't have an environment that adapts to it it has to adapt to the environment ricky thank you very much for having me rw that 's terrific thank you .thank you very much please excuse me for sitting i 'm very old well the topic i 'm going to discuss is one which is in a certain sense very peculiar because it 's very old roughness is part of human life forever and forever and ancient authors have written about it it was very much uncontrollable and in a certain sense it seemed to be the extreme of complexity just a mess a mess and a mess there are many different kinds of mess now in fact by a complete fluke i got involved many years ago in a study of this form of complexity and to my utter amazement i found traces [UNK] very strong traces i must say [UNK] of order in that roughness and so today i would like to present to you a few examples of what this represents i prefer the word roughness to the word irregularity because irregularity [UNK] to someone who had latin in my long-past youth [UNK] means the contrary of regularity but it is not so regularity is the contrary of roughness because the basic aspect of the world is very rough so let me show you a few objects some of them are artificial others of them are very real in a certain sense now this is the real it 's a cauliflower now why do i show a cauliflower a very ordinary and ancient vegetable because old and ancient as it may be it 's very complicated and it 's very simple both at the same time if you try to weigh it [UNK] of course it 's very easy to weigh it and when you eat it the weight matters [UNK] but suppose you try to measure its surface well it 's very interesting if you cut with a sharp knife one of the florets of a cauliflower and look at it separately you think of a whole cauliflower but smaller and then you cut again again again again again again again again again and you still get small cauliflowers so the experience of humanity has always been that there are some shapes which have this peculiar property that each part is like the whole but smaller now what did humanity do with that very very little so what i did actually is to study this problem and i found something quite surprising that one can measure roughness by a number a number 2.3 1.2 and sometimes much more one day a friend of mine to bug me brought a picture and said " what is the roughness of this curve " i said " well just short of 1.5 " it was 1.48 now it did n't take me any time i 've been looking at these things for so long so these numbers are the numbers which denote the roughness of these surfaces i hasten to say that these surfaces are completely artificial they were done on a computer and the only input is a number and that number is roughness so on the left i took the roughness copied from many landscapes to the right i took a higher roughness so the eye after a while can distinguish these two very well humanity had to learn about measuring roughness this is very rough and this is sort of smooth and this perfectly smooth very few things are very smooth so then if you try to ask questions " what 's the surface of a cauliflower " well you measure and measure and measure each time you 're closer it gets bigger down to very very small distances what 's the length of the coastline of these lakes the closer you measure the longer it is the concept of length of coastline which seems to be so natural because it 's given in many cases is in fact complete fallacy there 's no such thing you must do it differently what good is that to know these things well surprisingly enough it 's good in many ways to begin with artificial landscapes which i invented sort of are used in cinema all the time we see mountains in the distance they may be mountains but they may be just formulae just cranked on now it 's very easy to do it used to be very time-consuming but now it 's nothing now look at that that 's a real lung now a lung is something very strange if you take this thing you know very well it weighs very little the volume of a lung is very small but what about the area of the lung anatomists were arguing very much about that some say that a normal male 's lung has an area of the inside of a basketball [ court ] and the others say no five basketball [ courts ] enormous disagreements why so because in fact the area of the lung is something very ill-defined the bronchi branch branch branch and they stop branching not because of any matter of principle but because of physical considerations the mucus which is in the lung so what happens is that in a way you have a much bigger lung but it branches and branches down to distances about the same for a whale for a man and for a little rodent now what good is it to have that well surprisingly enough amazingly enough the anatomists had a very poor idea of the structure of the lung until very recently and i think that my mathematics surprisingly enough has been of great help to the surgeons studying lung illnesses and also kidney illnesses all these branching systems for which there was no geometry so i found myself in other words constructing a geometry a geometry of things which had no geometry and a surprising aspect of it is that very often the rules of this geometry are extremely short you have formulas that long and you crank it several times sometimes repeatedly again again again the same repetition and at the end you get things like that this cloud is completely 100 percent artificial well 99.9 and the only part which is natural is a number the roughness of the cloud which is taken from nature something so complicated like a cloud so unstable so varying should have a simple rule behind it now this simple rule is not an explanation of clouds the seer of clouds had to take account of it i do n't know how much advanced these pictures are they 're old i was very much involved in it but then turned my attention to other phenomena now here is another thing which is rather interesting one of the shattering events in the history of mathematics which is not appreciated by many people occurred about 130 years ago 145 years ago mathematicians began to create shapes that did n't exist mathematicians got into self-praise to an extent which was absolutely amazing that man can invent things that nature did not know in particular it could invent things like a curve which fills the plane a curve 's a curve a plane 's a plane and the two wo n't mix well they do mix a man named peano did define such curves and it became an object of extraordinary interest it was very important but mostly interesting because a kind of break a separation between the mathematics coming from reality on the one hand and new mathematics coming from pure man 's mind well i was very sorry to point out that the pure man 's mind has in fact seen at long last what had been seen for a long time and so here i introduce something the set of rivers of a plane-filling curve and well it 's a story unto itself so it was in 1875 to 1925 an extraordinary period in which mathematics prepared itself to break out from the world and the objects which were used as examples when i was a child and a student as examples of the break between mathematics and visible reality [UNK] those objects i turned them completely around i used them for describing some of the aspects of the complexity of nature well a man named hausdorff in 1919 introduced a number which was just a mathematical joke and i found that this number was a good measurement of roughness when i first told it to my friends in mathematics they said " do n't be silly it 's just something [ silly ] " well actually i was not silly the great painter hokusai knew it very well the things on the ground are algae he did not know the mathematics it did n't yet exist and he was japanese who had no contact with the west but painting for a long time had a fractal side i could speak of that for a long time the eiffel tower has a fractal aspect i read the book that mr. eiffel wrote about his tower and indeed it was astonishing how much he understood this is a mess mess mess brownian loop one day i decided [UNK] halfway through my career i was held by so many things in my work [UNK] i decided to test myself could i just look at something which everybody had been looking at for a long time and find something dramatically new well so i looked at these things called brownian motion [UNK] just goes around i played with it for a while and i made it return to the origin then i was telling my assistant " i do n't see anything can you paint it " so he painted it which means he put inside everything he said " well this thing came out 1 " and i said " stop 1 stop 1 stop 1 i see it 's an island " and amazing so brownian motion which happens to have a roughness number of two goes around i measured it 1.33 again again again long measurements big brownian motions 1.33 mathematical problem how to prove it it took my friends 20 years three of them were having incomplete proofs they got together and together they had the proof so they got the big [ fields ] medal in mathematics one of the three medals that people have received for proving things which i 've seen without being able to prove them now everybody asks me at one point or another " how did it all start what got you in that strange business " what got you to be at the same time a mechanical engineer a geographer and a mathematician and so on a physicist well actually i started oddly enough studying stock market prices and so here i had this theory and i wrote books about it [UNK] financial prices increments to the left you see data over a long period to the right on top you see a theory which is very very fashionable it was very easy and you can write many books very fast about it there are thousands of books on that now compare that with real price increments where are real price increments well these other lines include some real price increments and some forgery which i did so the idea there was that one must be able to [UNK] how do you say [UNK] model price variation and it went really well 50 years ago for 50 years people were sort of pooh-poohing me because they could do it much much easier but i tell you at this point people listened to me these two curves are averages standard & amp poor the blue one and the red one is standard & amp poor 's from which the five biggest discontinuities are taken out now discontinuities are a nuisance so in many studies of prices one puts them aside " well acts of god and you have the little nonsense which is left acts of god " in this picture five acts of god are as important as everything else in other words it is not acts of god that we should put aside that is the meat the problem if you master these you master price and if you do n't master these you can master the little noise as well as you can but it 's not important well here are the curves for it now i get to the final thing which is the set of which my name is attached in a way it 's the story of my life my adolescence was spent during the german occupation of france since i thought that i might vanish within a day or a week i had very big dreams and after the war i saw an uncle again my uncle was a very prominent mathematician and he told me " look there 's a problem which i could not solve 25 years ago and which nobody can solve this is a construction of a man named [ gaston ] julia and [ pierre ] fatou if you could find something new anything you will get your career made " very simple so i looked and like the thousands of people that had tried before i found nothing but then the computer came and i decided to apply the computer not to new problems in mathematics [UNK] like this wiggle wiggle that 's a new problem [UNK] but to old problems and i went from what 's called real numbers which are points on a line to imaginary complex numbers which are points on a plane which is what one should do there and this shape came out this shape is of an extraordinary complication the equation is hidden there z goes into z squared plus c it 's so simple so dry it 's so uninteresting now you turn the crank once twice twice marvels come out i mean this comes out i do n't want to explain these things this comes out this comes out shapes which are of such complication such harmony and such beauty this comes out repeatedly again again again and that was one of my major discoveries to find that these islands were the same as the whole big thing more or less and then you get these extraordinary baroque decorations all over the place all that from this little formula which has whatever five symbols in it and then this one the color was added for two reasons first of all because these shapes are so complicated that one could n't make any sense of the numbers and if you plot them you must choose some system and so my principle has been to always present the shapes with different colorings because some colorings emphasize that and others it is that or that it 's so complicated in 1990 i was in cambridge u.k to receive a prize from the university and three days later a pilot was flying over the landscape and found this thing so where did this come from obviously from extraterrestrials well so the newspaper in cambridge published an article about that " discovery " and received the next day 5,000 letters from people saying " but that 's simply a mandelbrot set very big " well let me finish this shape here just came out of an exercise in pure mathematics bottomless wonders spring from simple rules which are repeated without end thank you very much .i have a tough job to do you know when i looked at the profile of the audience here with their connotations and design in all its forms and with so much and so many people working on collaborative and networks and so on that i wanted to tell you i wanted to build an argument for primary education in a very specific context in order to do that in 20 minutes i have to bring out four ideas [UNK] it 's like four pieces of a puzzle and if i succeed in doing that maybe you would go back with the thought that you could build on and perhaps help me do my work the first piece of the puzzle is remoteness and the quality of education now by remoteness i mean two or three different kinds of things of course remoteness in its normal sense which means that as you go further and further away from an urban center you get to remoter areas what happens to education the second or a different kind of remoteness is that within the large metropolitan areas all over the world you have pockets like slums or shantytowns or poorer areas which are socially and economically remote from the rest of the city so it 's us and them what happens to education in that context so keep both of those ideas of remoteness we made a guess the guess was that schools in remote areas do not have good enough teachers if they do have they can not retain those teachers they do not have good enough infrastructure and if they had some infrastructure they have difficulty maintaining it but i wanted to check if this is true so what i did last year was we hired a car looked up on google found a route into northern india from new delhi which you know which did not cross any big cities or any big metropolitan centers drove out about 300 kilometers and wherever we found a school administered a set of standard tests and then took those test results and plotted them on a graph the graph was interesting although you need to consider it carefully i mean this is a very small sample you should not generalize from it but it was quite obvious quite clear that for this particular route that i had taken the remoter the school was the worse its results seemed to be that seemed a little damning and i tried to correlate it with things like infrastructure or with the availability of electricity and things like that to my surprise it did not correlate it did not correlate with the size of classrooms it did not correlate with the quality of the infrastructure it did not correlate with the poverty levels it did not correlate but what happened was that when i administered a questionnaire to each of these schools with one single question for the teachers [UNK] which was " would you like to move to an urban metropolitan area " [UNK] 69 percent of them said yes and as you can see from that they say yes just a little bit out of delhi and they say no when you hit the rich suburbs of delhi [UNK] because you know those are relatively better off areas [UNK] and then from 200 kilometers out of delhi the answer is consistently yes i would imagine that a teacher who comes or walks into class every day thinking that i wish i was in some other school probably has a deep impact on what happens to the results so it looked as though teacher motivation and teacher migration was a powerfully correlated thing with what was happening in primary schools as opposed to whether the children have enough to eat and whether they are packed tightly into classrooms and that sort of thing it appears that way when you take education and technology then i find in the literature that you know things like websites collaborative environments [UNK] you 've been listening to all that in the morning [UNK] it 's always piloted first in the best schools the best urban schools and according to me biases the result the literature [UNK] one part of it the scientific literature [UNK] consistently blames et as being over-hyped and under-performing the teachers always say well it 's fine but it 's too expensive for what it does because it 's being piloted in a school where the students are already getting let 's say 80 percent of whatever they could do you put in this new super-duper technology and now they get 83 percent so the principal looks at it and says 3 percent for 300,000 dollars forget it if you took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools where the score was 30 percent and let 's say took that up to 40 percent [UNK] that will be a completely different thing so the relative change that et educational technology would make would be far greater at the bottom of the pyramid than at the top but we seem to be doing it the other way about so i came to this conclusion that et should reach the underprivileged first not the other way about and finally came the question of how do you tackle teacher perception whenever you go to a teacher and show them some technology the teacher 's first reaction is you can not replace a teacher with a machine [UNK] it 's impossible i do n't know why it 's impossible but even for a moment if you did assume that it 's impossible [UNK] i have a quotation from sir arthur c. clarke the science fiction writer whom i met in colombo and he said something which completely solves this problem he said a teacher than can be replaced by a machine should be so you know it puts the teacher into a tough bind you have to think anyway so i 'm proposing that an alternative primary education whatever alternative you want is required where schools do n't exist where schools are not good enough where teachers are not available or where teachers are not good enough for whatever reason if you happen to live in a part of the world where none of this applies then you do n't need an alternative education so far i have n't come across such an area except for one case i wo n't name the area but somewhere in the world people said we do n't have this problem because we have perfect teachers and perfect schools there are such areas but [UNK] anyway i 'd never heard that anywhere else i 'm going to talk about children and self-organization and a set of experiments which sort of led to this idea of what might an alternative education be like they 're called the hole-in-the-wall experiments i 'll have to really rush through this they 're a set of experiments the first one was done in new delhi in 1999 and what we did over there was pretty much simple i had an office in those days which bordered a slum an urban slum so there was a dividing wall between our office and the urban slum they cut a hole inside that wall [UNK] which is how it has got the name hole-in-the-wall [UNK] and put a pretty powerful pc into that hole sort of embedded into the wall so that its monitor was sticking out at the other end a touchpad similarly embedded into the wall put it on high-speed internet put the internet explorer there put it on altavista.com [UNK] in those days [UNK] and just left it there and this is what we saw so that was my office in iit here 's the hole-in-the-wall about eight hours later we found this kid to the right is this eight-year-old child who [UNK] and to his left is a six-year-old girl who is not very tall and what he was doing was he was teaching her to browse so it sort of raised more questions than it answered is this real does the language matter because he 's not supposed to know english will the computer last or will they break it and steal it [UNK] and did anyone teach them the last question is what everybody said but you know i mean they must have poked their head over the wall and asked the people in your office can you show me how to do it and then somebody taught him so i took the experiment out of delhi and repeated it this time in a city called shivpuri in the center of india where i was assured that nobody had ever taught anybody anything so it was a warm day and the hole in the wall was on that decrepit old building this is the first kid who came there he later on turned out to be a 13-year-old school dropout he came there and he started to fiddle around with the touchpad very quickly he noticed that when he moves his finger on the touchpad something moves on the screen [UNK] and later on he told me " i have never seen a television where you can do something " so he figured that out it took him over two minutes to figure out that he was doing things to the television and then as he was doing that he made an accidental click by hitting the touchpad [UNK] you 'll see him do that he did that and the internet explorer changed page eight minutes later he looked from his hand to the screen and he was browsing he was going back and forth when that happened he started calling all the neighborhood children like children would come and see what 's happening over here and by the evening of that day 70 children were all browsing so eight minutes and an embedded computer seemed to be all that we needed there so we thought that this is what was happening that children in groups can self-instruct themselves to use a computer and the internet but under what circumstances at this time there was a [UNK] the main question was about english people said you know you really ought to have this in indian languages so i said have what shall i translate the internet into some indian language that 's not possible so it has to be the other way about but let 's see how do the children tackle the english language i took the experiment out to northeastern india to a village called madantusi where for some reason there was no english teacher so the children had not learned english at all and i built a similar hole-in-the-wall one big difference in the villages as opposed to the urban slums there were more girls than boys who came to the kiosk in the urban slums the girls tend to stay away i left the computer there with lots of cds [UNK] i did n't have any internet [UNK] and came back three months later so when i came back there i found these two kids eight- and 12-year-olds who were playing a game on the computer and as soon as they saw me they said " we need a faster processor and a better mouse " i was real surprised you know how on earth did they know all this and they said " well we 've picked it up from the cds " so i said " but how did you understand what 's going on over there " so they said " well you 've left this machine which talks only in english so we had to learn english " so then i measured and they were using 200 english words with each other [UNK] mispronounced but correct usage [UNK] words like exit stop find save that kind of thing not only to do with the computer but in their day-to-day conversations so madantusi seemed to show that language is not a barrier in fact they may be able to teach themselves the language if they really wanted to finally i got some funding to try this experiment out to see if these results are replicable if they happen everywhere else india is a good place to do such an experiment in because we have all the ethnic diversities all the [UNK] you know the genetic diversity all the racial diversities and also all the socio-economic diversities so i could actually choose samples to cover a cross section that would cover practically the whole world so i did this for almost five years and this experiment really took us all the way across the length and breadth of india this is the himalayas up in the north very cold i also had to check or invent an engineering design which would survive outdoors and i was using regular normal pcs so i needed different climates for which india is also great because we have very cold very hot and so on this is the desert to the west near the pakistan border and you see here a little clip of [UNK] one of these villages [UNK] the first thing that these children did was to find a website to teach themselves the english alphabet then to central india [UNK] very warm moist fishing villages where humidity is a very big killer of electronics so we had to solve all the problems we had without air conditioning and with very poor power so most of the solutions that came out used little blasts of air put at the right places to keep the machines running i want to just cut this short we did this over and over again this sequence is also nice this is a small child a six-year-old telling his eldest sister what to do and this happens very often with these computers that the younger children are found teaching the older ones what did we find we found that six- to 13-year-olds can self-instruct in a connected environment irrespective of anything that we could measure so if they have access to the computer they will teach themselves including intelligence i could n't find a single correlation with anything but it had to be in groups and that may be of great you know interest to this group because all of you are talking about groups so here was the power of what a group of children can do if you lift the adult intervention just a quick idea of the measurements we took standard statistical techniques so i 'm going to not talk about that but we got a clean learning curve almost exactly the same as what you would get in a school i 'll leave it at that because i mean it sort of says it all does n't it what could they learn to do basic windows functions browsing painting chatting and email games and educational material music downloads playing video in short what all of us do and over 300 children will become computer literate and be able to do all of these things in six months with one computer so how do they do that if you calculated the actual time of access it would work out to minutes per day so that 's not how it 's happening what you have actually is there is one child operating the computer and surrounding him are usually three other children who are advising him on what they should do if you test them all four will get the same scores in whatever you ask them around these four are usually a group of about 16 children who are also advising usually wrongly about everything that 's going on on the computer and all of them also will clear a test given on that subject so they are learning as much by watching as they learn by doing it seems counter-intuitive to adult learning but remember eight-year-olds live in a society where most of the time they are told do n't do this you know do n't touch the whiskey bottle so what does the eight-year-old do he observes very carefully how a whiskey bottle should be touched and if you tested him he would answer every question correctly on that topic so they seem to be able to acquire very quickly so what was the conclusion over the six years of work it was that primary education can happen on its own or parts of it can happen on its own it does not have to be imposed from the top downwards it could perhaps be a self-organizing system so that was the second bit that i wanted to tell you that children can self-organize and attain an educational objective the third piece was on values and again to put it very briefly i conducted a test over 500 children spread across all over india and asked them [UNK] i gave them about 68 different values-oriented questions and simply asked them their opinions we got all sorts of opinions yes no or i do n't know i simply took those questions where i got 50 percent yeses and 50 percent noes [UNK] so i was able to get a collection of 16 such statements these were areas where the children were clearly confused because half said yes and half said no a typical example being " sometimes it is necessary to tell lies " they do n't have a way to determine which way to answer this question perhaps none of us do so i leave you with this third question can technology alter the acquisition of values finally self-organizing systems about which again i wo n't say too much because you 've been hearing all about it natural systems are all self-organizing galaxies molecules cells organisms societies [UNK] except for the debate about an intelligent designer but at this point in time as far as science goes it 's self-organization but other examples are traffic jams stock market society and disaster recovery terrorism and insurgency and you know about the internet-based self-organizing systems so here are my four sentences then remoteness affects the quality of education educational technology should be introduced into remote areas first and other areas later values are acquired doctrine and dogma are imposed [UNK] the two opposing mechanisms and learning is most likely a self-organizing system if you put all the four together then it gives [UNK] according to me [UNK] it gives us a goal a vision for educational technology an educational technology and pedagogy that is digital automatic fault-tolerant minimally invasive connected and self-organized as educationists we have never asked for technology we keep borrowing it powerpoint is supposed to be considered a great educational technology but it was not meant for education it was meant for making boardroom presentations we borrowed it video conferencing the personal computer itself i think it 's time that the educationists made their own specs and i have such a set of specs this is a brief look at that and such a set of specs should produce the technology to address remoteness values and violence so i thought i 'd give it a name [UNK] why do n't we call it " outdoctrination " and could this be a goal for educational technology in the future so i want to leave that as a thought with you thank you .i 'd like to talk to you today about the human brain which is what we do research on at the university of california just think about this problem for a second here is a lump of flesh about three pounds which you can hold in the palm of your hand but it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space it can contemplate the meaning of infinity ask questions about the meaning of its own existence about the nature of god and this is truly the most amazing thing in the world it 's the greatest mystery confronting human beings how does this all come about well the brain as you know is made up of neurons we 're looking at neurons here there are 100 billion neurons in the adult human brain and each neuron makes something like 1,000 to 10,000 contacts with other neurons in the brain and based on this people have calculated that the number of permutations and combinations of brain activity exceeds the number of elementary particles in the universe so how do you go about studying the brain one approach is to look at patients who had lesions in different part of the brain and study changes in their behavior this is what i spoke about in the last ted today i 'll talk about a different approach which is to put electrodes in different parts of the brain and actually record the activity of individual nerve cells in the brain sort of eavesdrop on the activity of nerve cells in the brain now one recent discovery that has been made by researchers in italy in parma by giacomo rizzolatti and his colleagues is a group of neurons called mirror neurons which are on the front of the brain in the frontal lobes now it turns out there are neurons which are called ordinary motor command neurons in the front of the brain which have been known for over 50 years these neurons will fire when a person performs a specific action for example if i do that and reach and grab an apple a motor command neuron in the front of my brain will fire if i reach out and pull an object another neuron will fire commanding me to pull that object these are called motor command neurons that have been known for a long time but what rizzolatti found was a subset of these neurons maybe about 20 percent of them will also fire when i 'm looking at somebody else performing the same action so here is a neuron that fires when i reach and grab something but it also fires when i watch joe reaching and grabbing something and this is truly astonishing because it 's as though this neuron is adopting the other person 's point of view it 's almost as though it 's performing a virtual reality simulation of the other person 's action now what is the significance of these mirror neurons for one thing they must be involved in things like imitation and emulation because to imitate a complex act requires my brain to adopt the other person 's point of view so this is important for imitation and emulation well why is that important well let 's take a look at the next slide so how do you do imitation why is imitation important mirror neurons and imitation emulation now let 's look at culture the phenomenon of human culture if you go back in time about [ 75,000 ] to 100,000 years ago let 's look at human evolution it turns out that something very important happened around 75,000 years ago and that is there is a sudden emergence and rapid spread of a number of skills that are unique to human beings like tool use the use of fire the use of shelters and of course language and the ability to read somebody else 's mind and interpret that person 's behavior all of that happened relatively quickly even though the human brain had achieved its present size almost three or four hundred thousand years ago 100,000 years ago all of this happened very very quickly and i claim that what happened was the sudden emergence of a sophisticated mirror neuron system which allowed you to emulate and imitate other people 's actions so that when there was a sudden accidental discovery by one member of the group say the use of fire or a particular type of tool instead of dying out this spread rapidly horizontally across the population or was transmitted vertically down the generations so this made evolution suddenly lamarckian instead of darwinian darwinian evolution is slow it takes hundreds of thousands of years a polar bear to evolve a coat will take thousands of generations maybe 100,000 years a human being a child can just watch its parent kill another polar bear and skin it and put the skin on its body fur on the body and learn it in one step what the polar bear took 100,000 years to learn it can learn in five minutes maybe 10 minutes and then once it 's learned this it spreads in geometric proportion across a population this is the basis the imitation of complex skills is what we call culture and is the basis of civilization now there is another kind of mirror neuron which is involved in something quite different and that is there are mirror neurons just as there are mirror neurons for action there are mirror neurons for touch in other words if somebody touches me my hand neuron in the somatosensory cortex in the sensory region of the brain fires but the same neuron in some cases will fire when i simply watch another person being touched so it 's empathizing the other person being touched so most of them will fire when i 'm touched in different locations different neurons for different locations but a subset of them will fire even when i watch somebody else being touched in the same location so here again you have neurons which are enrolled in empathy now the question then arises if i simply watch another person being touched why do i not get confused and literally feel that touch sensation merely by watching somebody being touched i mean i empathize with that person but i do n't literally feel the touch well that 's because you 've got receptors in your skin touch and pain receptors going back into your brain and saying " do n't worry you 're not being touched so empathize by all means with the other person but do not actually experience the touch otherwise you 'll get confused and muddled " okay so there is a feedback signal that vetoes the signal of the mirror neuron preventing you from consciously experiencing that touch but if you remove the arm you simply anesthetize my arm so you put an injection into my arm anesthetize the brachial plexus so the arm is numb and there is no sensations coming in if i now watch you being touched i literally feel it in my hand in other words you have dissolved the barrier between you and other human beings so i call them gandhi neurons or empathy neurons and this is not in some abstract metaphorical sense all that 's separating you from him from the other person is your skin remove the skin you experience that person 's touch in your mind you 've dissolved the barrier between you and other human beings and this of course is the basis of much of eastern philosophy and that is there is no real independent self aloof from other human beings inspecting the world inspecting other people you are in fact connected not just via facebook and internet you 're actually quite literally connected by your neurons and there is whole chains of neurons around this room talking to each other and there is no real distinctiveness of your consciousness from somebody else 's consciousness and this is not mumbo-jumbo philosophy it emerges from our understanding of basic neuroscience so you have a patient with a phantom limb if the arm has been removed and you have a phantom and you watch somebody else being touched you feel it in your phantom now the astonishing thing is if you have pain in your phantom limb you squeeze the other person 's hand massage the other person 's hand that relieves the pain in your phantom hand almost as though the neuron were obtaining relief from merely watching somebody else being massaged so here you have my last slide for the longest time people have regarded science and humanities as being distinct c.p snow spoke of the two cultures science on the one hand humanities on the other never the twain shall meet so i 'm saying the mirror neuron system underlies the interface allowing you to rethink about issues like consciousness representation of self what separates you from other human beings what allows you to empathize with other human beings and also even things like the emergence of culture and civilization which is unique to human beings thank you .in the next 18 minutes i 'm going to take you on a journey and it 's a journey that you and i have been on for many years now and it began some 50 years ago when humans first stepped off our planet and in those 50 years not only did we literally physically set foot on the moon but we have dispatched robotic spacecraft to all the planets [UNK] all eight of them [UNK] and we have landed on asteroids we have rendezvoused with comets and at this point in time we have a spacecraft on its way to pluto the body formerly known as a planet and all of these robotic missions are part of a bigger human journey a voyage to understand something to get a sense of our cosmic place to understand something of our origins and how earth our planet and we living on it came to be and of all the places in the solar system that we might go to and search for answers to questions like this there 's saturn and we have been to saturn before [UNK] we visited saturn in the early 1980s [UNK] but our investigations of saturn have become far more in-depth in detail since the cassini spacecraft traveling across interplanetary space for seven years glided into orbit around saturn in the summer of 2004 and became at that point the farthest robotic outpost that humanity had ever established around the sun now the saturn system is a rich planetary system it offers mystery scientific insight and obviously splendor beyond compare and the investigation of this system has enormous cosmic reach in fact just studying the rings alone we stand to learn a lot about the discs of stars and gas that we call the spiral galaxies and here 's a beautiful picture of the andromeda nebula which is our closest largest spiral galaxy to the milky way and then here 's a beautiful composite of the whirlpool galaxy taken by the hubble space telescope so the journey back to saturn is really part of and is also a metaphor for a much larger human voyage to understand the interconnectedness of everything around us and also how humans fit into that picture and it pains me that i ca n't tell you all that we have learned with cassini i ca n't show you all the beautiful pictures that we 've taken in the last two and a half years because i simply do n't have the time so i 'm going to concentrate on two of the most exciting stories that have emerged out of this major exploratory expedition that we are conducting around saturn and have been for the past two and a half years saturn is accompanied by a very large and diverse collection of moons they range in size from a few kilometers across to as big across as the u.s most of the beautiful pictures we 've taken of saturn in fact show saturn in accompaniment with some of its moons here 's saturn with dione and then here 's saturn showing the rings edge-on showing you just how vertically thin they are with the moon enceladus now two of the 47 moons that saturn has are standouts and those are titan and enceladus titan is saturn 's largest moon and until cassini had arrived there was the largest single expanse of unexplored terrain that we had remaining in our solar system and it is a body that has long intrigued people who 've watched the planets it has a very large thick atmosphere and in fact its surface environment was believed to be more like the environment we have here on the earth or at least had in the past than any other body in the solar system its atmosphere is largely molecular nitrogen like you are breathing here in this room except that its atmosphere is suffused with simple organic materials like methane and propane and ethane and these molecules high up in the atmosphere of titan get broken down and their products join together to make haze particles this haze is ubiquitous it 's completely global and enveloping titan and that 's why you can not see down to the surface with our eyes in the visible region of the spectrum but these haze particles it was surmised before we got there with cassini over billions and billions of years gently drifted down to the surface and coated the surface in a thick organic sludge so like the equivalent the titan equivalent of tar or oil or what [UNK] we did n't know what but this is what we suspected and these molecules especially methane and ethane can be liquids at the surface temperatures of titan and so it turns out that methane is to titan what water is to the earth it 's a condensable in the atmosphere and so recognizing this circumstance brought to the fore a whole world of bizarre possibilities you can have methane clouds ok and above those clouds you have this hundreds of kilometers of haze which prevent any sunlight from getting to the surface the temperature at the surface is some 350 degrees below zero fahrenheit but despite that cold you could have rain falling down on the surface of titan and doing on titan what rain does on the earth it carves gullies it forms rivers and cataracts it can create canyons it can pool in large basins and craters it can wash the sludge off high mountain peaks and hills down into the lowlands so stop and think for a minute try to imagine what the surface of titan might look like it 's dark high noon on titan is as dark as deep earth twilight on the earth it 's cold it 's eerie it 's misty it might be raining and you might be standing on the shores of lake michigan brimming with paint thinner that is the view that we had of the surface of titan before we got there with cassini and i can tell you that what we have found on titan though it is not the same in detail is every bit as fascinating as that story is and for us it has been like [UNK] the cassini people [UNK] it has been like a jules verne adventure come true as i said it has a thick extensive atmosphere this is a picture of titan backlit by the sun with the rings as a beautiful backdrop and yet another moon there [UNK] i do n't even know which one it is it 's a very extensive atmosphere we have instruments on cassini which can see down to the surface through this atmosphere and my camera system is one of them and we have taken pictures like this and what you see is bright and dark regions and that 's about as far as it got for us it was so mystifying we could n't make out what we were seeing on titan when you look closer at this region you start to see things like sinuous channels [UNK] we did n't know you see a few round things this we later found out is in fact a crater but there are very few craters on the surface of titan meaning it 's a very young surface and there are features that look tectonic they look like they 've been pulled apart whenever you see anything linear on a planet it means there 's been a fracture like a fault and so it 's been tectonically altered but we could n't make sense of our images until six months after we got into orbit an event occurred that many have regarded as the highlight of cassini 's investigation of titan and that was the deployment of the huygens probe the european-built huygens probe that cassini had carried for seven years across the solar system we deployed it to the atmosphere of titan it took two and a half hours to descend and it landed on the surface and i just want to emphasize how significant an event this is this is a device of human making and it landed in the outer solar system for the first time in human history it is so significant that in my mind this was an event that should have been celebrated with ticker tape parades in every city across the u.s. and europe and sadly that was n't the case it was significant for another reason this is an international mission and this event was celebrated in europe in germany and the celebratory presentations were given in english accents and american accents and german accents and french and italian and dutch accents it was a moving demonstration of what the words " united nations " are supposed to mean a true union of nations joined together in a colossal effort for good and in this case it was a massive undertaking to explore a planet and to come to understand a planetary system that for all of human history had been unreachable and now humans had actually touched it so it was [UNK] i mean i 'm getting goose bumps just talking about it it was a tremendously emotional event and it 's something that i will personally never forget and you should n't either but anyway the probe took measurements of the atmosphere on the way down and it also took panoramic pictures and i ca n't tell you what it was like to see the first pictures of titan 's surface from the probe and this is what we saw and it was a shocker because it was everything we wanted those other pictures taken from orbit to be it was an unambiguous pattern a geological pattern it 's a dendritic drainage pattern that can be formed only by the flow of liquids and you can follow these channels and you can see how they all converge and they converge into this channel here which drains into this region you are looking at a shoreline was this a shoreline of fluids we did n't know but this is somewhat of a shoreline this picture is taken at 16 kilometers this is the picture taken at eight kilometers ok again the shoreline okay now 16 kilometers eight kilometers [UNK] this is roughly an airline altitude if you were going to take an airplane trip across the u.s. you would be flying at these altitudes so this is the picture you would have at the window of titanian airlines as you fly across the surface of titan and then finally the probe came to rest on the surface and i 'm going to show you ladies and gentlemen the first picture ever taken from the surface of a moon in the outer solar system and here is the horizon ok these are probably water ice pebbles yes and obviously it landed in one of these flat dark regions and it did n't sink out of sight so it was n't fluid that we landed in what the probe came down in was basically the titan equivalent of a mud flat this is an unconsolidated ground that is suffused with liquid methane and it 's probably the case that this material has washed off the highlands of titan through these channels that we saw and has drained over billions of years to fill in low-lying basins and that is what the huygens probe landed in but still there was no sign in our images or even in the huygens ' images of any large open bodies of fluids where were they it got even more puzzling when we found dunes ok so this is our movie of the equatorial region of titan showing these dunes these are dunes that are 100 meters tall separated by a few kilometers and they go on for miles and miles and miles there 's hundreds up to a 1,000 or 1,200 miles of dunes this is the saharan desert of titan it 's obviously a place which is very dry or you would n't get dunes so again it got puzzling that there were no bodies of fluid until finally we saw lakes in the polar regions and there is a lake scene in the south polar region of titan it 's about the size of lake ontario and then only a week and a half ago we flew over the north pole of titan and found again we found a feature here the size of the caspian sea so it seems that the liquids for some reason we do n't understand or during at least this season are apparently at the poles of titan and i think you would agree that we have found titan is a remarkable mystical place it 's exotic it 's alien but yet strangely earth-like and having earth-like geological formations and a tremendous geographical diversity and is a fascinating world whose only rival in the solar system for complexity and richness is the earth itself and so now we go onto enceladus enceladus is a small moon it 's about a tenth the size of titan and you can see it here next to england just to show you the size this is not meant to be a threat and enceladus is very white it 's very bright and its surface is obviously wrecked with fractures it is a very geologically active body but the mother lode of discoveries on enceladus was found at the south pole [UNK] and we 're looking at the south pole here [UNK] where we found this system of fractures and they 're a different color because they 're a different composition they are coated these fractures are coated with organic materials moreover this whole entire region the south polar region has elevated temperatures it 's the hottest place on the planet on the body that 's as bizarre as finding that the antarctic on the earth is hotter than the tropics and then when we took additional pictures we discovered that from these fractures are issuing jets of fine icy particles extending hundreds of miles into space and when we color-code this image to bring out the faint light levels we see that these jets feed a plume that in fact we see in other images goes thousands of miles into the space above enceladus my team and i have examined images like this and like this one and have thought about the other results from cassini and we have arrived at the conclusion that these jets may be erupting from pockets of liquid water under the surface of enceladus so we have possibly liquid water organic materials and excess heat in other words we have possibly stumbled upon the holy grail of modern day planetary exploration or in other words an environment that is potentially suitable for living organisms and i do n't think i need to tell you that the discovery of life elsewhere in our solar system whether it be on enceladus or elsewhere would have enormous cultural and scientific implications because if we could demonstrate that genesis had occurred not once but twice independently in our solar system then that means by inference it has occurred a staggering number of times throughout the universe and its 13.7 billion year history right now earth is the only planet still that we know is teeming with life it is precious it is unique it is still so far the only home we 've ever known and if any of you were alert and coherent during the 1960s [UNK] and we 'd forgive you if you were n't ok [UNK] you would remember this very famous picture taken by the apollo 8 astronauts in 1968 it was the first time that earth was imaged from space and it had an enormous impact on our sense of place in the universe and our sense of responsibility for the protection of our own planet well we on cassini have taken an equivalent first a picture that no human eye has ever seen before it is a total eclipse of the sun seen from the other side of saturn and in this impossibly beautiful picture you see the main rings backlit by the sun you see the refracted image of the sun and you see this ring created in fact by the exhalations of enceladus but as if that were n't brilliant enough we can spot in this beautiful image sight of our own planet cradled in the arms of saturn 's rings now there is something deeply moving about seeing ourselves from afar and capturing the sight of our little blue-ocean planet in the skies of other worlds and that and the perspective of ourselves that we gain from that may be in the end the finest reward that we earn from this journey of discovery that started half a century ago and thank you very much .in october 2010 the justice league of america will be teaming up with the 99 icons like batman superman wonder woman and their colleagues will be teaming up with icons jabbar noora jami and their colleagues it 's a story of intercultural intersections and what better group to have this conversation than those that grew out of fighting fascism in their respective histories and geographies as fascism took over europe in the 1930s an unlikely reaction came out of north america as christian iconography got changed and swastikas were created out of crucifixes batman and superman were created by jewish young men in the united states and canada also going back to the bible consider this like the prophets all the superheroes are missing parents superman 's parents die on krypton before the age of one bruce wayne who becomes batman loses his parents at the age of six in gotham city spiderman is raised by his aunt and uncle and all of them just like the prophets who get their message from god through gabriel get their message from above peter parker is in a library in manhattan when the spider descends from above and gives him his message through a bite bruce wayne is in his bedroom when a big bat flies over his head and he sees it as an omen to become batman superman is not only sent to earth from the heavens or krypton but he 's sent in a pod much like moses was on the nile and you hear the voice of his father jor-el saying to earth " i have sent to you my only son " these are clearly biblical archetypes and the thinking behind that was to create positive globally-resonating storylines that could be tied to the same things that other people were pulling mean messages out of because then the person that 's using religion for the wrong purpose just becomes a bad man with a bad message and it 's only by linking positive things that the negative can be delinked this is the kind of thinking that went into creating the 99 the 99 references the 99 attributes of allah in the koran things like generosity and mercy and foresight and wisdom and dozens of others that no two people in the world would disagree about it does n't matter what your religion is even if you 're an atheist you do n't raise your kid telling him you know " make sure you lie three times a day " those are basic human values and so the backstory of the 99 takes place in 1258 which history tells us the mongols invaded baghdad and destroyed it all the books from bait al-hikma library the most famous library in its day were thrown in the tigris river and the tigris changes color with ink it 's a story passed on generation after generation i rewrote that story and in my version the librarians find out that this is going to happen [UNK] and here 's a side note if you want a comic book to do well make the librarians the hero it always works well so the librarians find out and they get together a special solution a chemical solution called king 's water that when mixed with 99 stones would be able to save all that culture and history in the books but the mongols get there first the books and the solution get thrown in the tigris river some librarians escape and over the course of days and weeks they dip the stones into the tigris and suck up that collective wisdom that we all think is lost to civilization those stones have been smuggled as three prayer beads of 33 stones each through arabia into andalusia in spain where they 're safe for 200 years but in 1492 two important things happen the first is the fall of granada the last muslim enclave in europe the second is columbus finally gets funded to go to india but he gets lost so 33 of the stones are smuggled onto the nina the pinta and the santa maria and are spread in the new world thirty-three go on the silk road to china south asia and southeast asia and 33 are spread between europe the middle east and africa and now it 's 2010 and there are 99 heroes from 99 different countries now it 's very easy to assume that those books because they were from a library called bait al-hikma were muslim books but that 's not the case because the caliph that built that library his name was al-ma'mun [UNK] he was harun al-rashid 's son he had told his advisers " get me all the scholars to translate any book they can get their hands onto into arabic and i will pay them its weight in gold " after a while his advisers complained they said " your highness the scholars are cheating they 're writing in big handwriting to take more gold " to which he said " let them be because what they 're giving us is worth a lot more than what we 're paying them " so the idea of an open architecture an open knowledge is not new to my neck of the desert the concept centers on something called the noor stones noor is arabic for light so these 99 stones a few kind of rules in the game number one you do n't choose the stone the stone chooses you there 's a king arthur element to the storyline okay number two all of the 99 when they first get their stone or their power abuse it they use it for self-interest and there 's a very strong message in there that when you start abusing your stone you get taken advantage of by people who will exploit your powers okay number three the 99 stones all have within them a mechanism that self-updates now there are two groups that exist within the muslim world everybody believes the koran is for all time and all place some believe that means that the original interpretation from a couple thousand years ago is what 's relevant today i do n't belong there then there 's a group that believes the koran is a living breathing document and i captured that idea within these stones that self-update now the main bad guy rughal does not want these stones to update so he 's trying to get them to stop updating he ca n't use the stones but he can stop them and by stopping them he has more of a fascist agenda where he gets some of the 99 to work for him [UNK] they 're all wearing cookie-cutter same color uniforms they 're not allowed to individually express who they are and what they are and he controls them from the top down [UNK] whereas when they work for the other side eventually when they find out this is the wrong person they 've been manipulated they actually each one has a different colorful kind of dress and the last point about the 99 noor stones is this so the 99 work in teams of three why three a couple of reasons number one we have a thing within islam that you do n't leave a boy and a girl alone together because the third person is temptation or the devil right i think that 's there in all cultures right but this is not about religion it 's not about proselytizing there 's this very strong social message that needs to get to kind of the deepest crevices of intolerance and the only way to get there is to kind of play the game and so this is the way i dealt with it they work in teams of three two boys and a girl two girls and a boy three boys three girls no problem and the swiss psychoanalyst carl jung also spoke about the importance of the number three in all cultures so i figure i 'm covered well 1 i got accused in a few blogs that i was actually sent by the pope to preach the trinity and catholicism in the middle east so you [UNK] you believe who you want i gave you my version of the story so here 's some of the characters that we have mujiba from malaysia her main power is she 's able to answer any question she 's the trivial pursuit queen if you want but when she first gets her power she starts going on game shows and making money we have jabbar from saudi who starts breaking things when he has the power now mumita was a fun one to name mumita is the destroyer so the 99 attributes of allah have the yin and the yang there 's the powerful the hegemonous the strong and there 's also the kind the generous i 'm like are all the girls going to be kind and merciful and the guys all strong i 'm like you know what i 've met a few girls who were destroyers in my lifetime so 1 we have jami from hungary who first starts making weapons he 's the technology wiz musawwira from ghana hadya from pakistan jaleel from iran who uses fire and this is one of my favorites al-batina from yemen al-batina is the hidden so al-batina is hidden but she 's a superhero i came home to my wife and i said " i created a character after you " my wife is a saudi from yemeni roots and she said " show me " so i showed this she said " that 's not me " i said " look at the eyes they 're your eyes " so i promised my investors this would not be another made-in-fifth-world-country production this was going to be superman or it was n't worth my time or their money so from day one the people involved in the project bottom left is fabian nicieza writer for x-men and power rangers next to him is dan panosian one of the character creators for the modern-day x-men top right is stuart moore a writer for iron man next to him is john mccrea who was an inker for spiderman and we entered western consciousness with a tagline " next ramadan the world will have new heroes " back in 2005 now i went to dubai to an arab thought foundation conference and i was waiting by the coffee for the right journalist did n't have a product but had energy and i found somebody from the new york times and i cornered him and i pitched him and i think i scared him [UNK] because he basically promised me [UNK] we had no product [UNK] but he said " we 'll give you a paragraph in the arts section if you 'll just go away " so i said " great " so i called him up a few weeks afterward i said " hi hesa " and he said " hi " i said " happy new year " he said " thank you we had a baby " i said " congratulations " like i care right " so when 's the article coming out " he said " naif islam and cartoon that 's not timely you know maybe next week next month next year but you know it 'll come out " so a few days after that what happens what happens is the world erupts in the danish cartoon controversy i became timely so flurry of phone calls and emails from the new york times next thing you knew there 's a full page covering us positively january 22nd 2006 which changed our lives forever because anybody googling islam and cartoon or islam and comic guess what they got they got me and the 99 were like superheroes kind of flying out of what was happening around the world and that led to all kinds of things from being in curricula in universities and schools to [UNK] one of my favorite pictures i have from south asia it was a couple of men with long beards and a lot of girls wearing the hijab [UNK] it looked like a school the good news is they 're all holding copies of the 99 smiling and they found me to sign the picture the bad news is they were all photocopies so we did n't make a dime in revenue we 've been able to license the 99 comic books into eight languages so far [UNK] chinese indonesian hindi urdu turkish opened a theme park through a license in kuwait a year and a half ago called the 99 village theme park [UNK] 300,000 square feet 20 rides all with our characters a couple back-to-school licenses in spain and turkey but the biggest thing we 've done to date which is just amazing is that we 've done a 26-episode animated series which is done for global audiences in fact we 're already going to be in the u.s. and turkey we know it 's 3d cgi which is going to be very high-quality written in hollywood by the writers behind ben 10 and spiderman and star wars clone wars in this clip i 'm about to show you which has never been seen in the public before there is a struggle two of the characters jabbar the one with the muscles and noora the one that can use light are actually wearing the cookie-cutter fascist gray uniform because they 're being manipulated they do n't know ok and they 're trying to get another member of the 99 to join them so there 's a struggle within the team so if we can get the lights 1 [ " the 99 " ] jabbar dana i ca n't see where to grab hold i need more light what 's happening dana there 's too much darkness rughal there must be something we can do man i wo n't send any more commandos in until i know it 's safe dr. razem it 's time to go miklos miklos must download file contents i ca n't forget auntie jabbar dana i ca n't do this without you dana but i ca n't help jabbar you can even if you do n't believe in yourself right now i believe in you you are noora the light dana no i do n't deserve it i do n't deserve anything jabbar then what about the rest of us do n't we deserve to be saved do n't i now tell me which way to go dana that way alarm threat imminent jabbar aaaahhh 1 miklos stay away from me jabbar we 're here to help you dr. razem do n't listen to them dana miklos that man is not your friend miklos no he gave me access and you want to reboot the [ unclear ] no more [ unclear ] [ " the 99 " ] thank you so " the 99 " is technology it 's entertainment it 's design but that 's only half the story as the father of five sons i worry about who they 're going to be using as role models i worry because all around me even within my extended family i see religion being manipulated as a psychologist i worry for the world in general but worry about the perception of how people see themselves in my part of the world now i 'm a clinical psychologist i 'm licensed in new york state i trained at bellevue hospital survivors of political torture program and i heard one too many stories of people growing up to idolize their leadership only to end up being tortured by their heroes and torture 's a terrible enough thing as it is but when it 's done by your hero that just breaks you in so many ways i left bellevue went to business school and started this now one of the things that i refer to when i [UNK] about the importance of this message [UNK] is that i gave a lecture at the medical school at kuwait university where i lecture on the biological basis of behavior and i gave the students two articles one from the new york times and one from new york magazine and i took away the name of the writer the name of the [ unclear ] [UNK] everything was gone except the facts and the first one was about a group called the party of god who wanted to ban valentine 's day red was made illegal any boys and girls caught flirting would get married off immediately okay the second one was about a woman complaining because three minivans with six bearded men pulled up and started interrogating her on the spot for talking to a man who was n't related to her and i asked the students in kuwait where they thought these incidents took place the first one they said saudi arabia there was no debate the second one they were actually split between saudi and afghanistan what blew their mind was the first one took place in india it was the party of a hindu god the second one took place in upstate new york it was an orthodox jewish community but what breaks my heart and what 's alarming is that in those two interviews the people around who were interviewed as well refer to that behavior as talibanization in other words good hindus and good jews do n't act this way this is islam 's influence on hinduism and judaism but what do the students in kuwait say they said it 's us [UNK] and this is dangerous it 's dangerous when a group self-identifies itself as extreme this is one of my sons rayan who 's a scooby doo addict you can tell by the glasses there he actually called me a meddling kid the other day but i borrow a lesson that i learned from him last summer when we were in our home in new york he was out in the yard playing in his playhouse and i was in my office working and he came in " baba i want you to come with me i want my toy " " yes rayan just go away " he left his scooby doo in his house i said " go away i 'm working i 'm busy " and what rayan did then is he sat there he tapped his foot on the floor at three and a half and he looked at me and he said " baba i want you to come with me to my office in my house i have work to do " rayan reframed the situation and brought himself down to my level and with the 99 that is what we aim to do you know i think that there 's a big parallel between bending the crucifix out of shape and creating swastikas and when i see pictures like this of parents or uncles who think it 's cute to have a little child holding a koran and having a suicide bomber belt around them to protest something the hope is by linking enough positive things to the koran that one day we can move this child from being proud in the way they 're proud there to that and i think [UNK] i think the 99 can and will achieve its mission as an undergrad at tufts university we were giving away free falafel one day and you know it was middle east day or something and people came up and picked up the culturally resonant image of the falafel ate it and you know talked and left and no two people could disagree about what the word free was and what the word falafel was behind us " free falafel " you know or so we thought until a woman came rushing across the campus and dropped her bag on the floor pointed up to the sign and said " who 's falafel " true story she was actually coming out of an amnesty international meeting just today d.c. comics announced the cover of our upcoming crossover on that cover you see batman superman and a fully-clothed wonder woman with our saudi member of the 99 our emirati member and our libyan member on april 26 2010 president barack obama said that of all the initiatives since his now famous cairo speech [UNK] in which he reached out to the muslim world [UNK] the most innovative was that the 99 reach back out to the justice league of america we live in a world in which the most culturally innocuous symbols like the falafel can be misunderstood because of baggage and where religion can be twisted and purposefully made where it 's not supposed to be by others in a world like that they 'll always be a job for superman and the 99 thank you very much .a human child is born and for quite a long time is a consumer it can not be consciously a contributor it is helpless it does n't know how to survive even though it is endowed with an instinct to survive it needs the help of mother or a foster mother to survive it ca n't afford to doubt the person who tends the child it has to totally surrender as one surrenders to an anesthesiologist it has to totally surrender that implies a lot of trust that implies the trusted person wo n't violate the trust as the child grows it begins to discover that the person trusted is violating the trust it does n't know even the word " violation " therefore it has to blame itself a wordless blame which is more difficult to really resolve [UNK] the wordless self-blame as the child grows to become an adult so far it has been a consumer but the growth of a human being lies in his or her capacity to contribute to be a contributor one can not contribute unless one feels secure one feels big one feels i have enough to be compassionate is not a joke it 's not that simple one has to discover a certain bigness in oneself that bigness should be centered on oneself not in terms of money not in terms of power you wield not in terms of any status that you can command in the society but it should be centered on oneself the self you are self-aware on that self it should be centered [UNK] a bigness a wholeness otherwise compassion is just a word and a dream you can be compassionate occasionally more moved by empathy than by compassion thank god we are empathetic when somebody 's in pain we pick up the pain in a wimbledon final match these two guys fight it out each one has got two games it can be anybody 's game what they have sweated so far has no meaning one person wins the tennis etiquette is both the players have to come to the net and shake hands the winner boxes the air and kisses the ground throws his shirt as though somebody is waiting for it and this guy has to come to the net when he comes to the net you see his whole face changes it looks as though he 's wishing that he did n't win why empathy that 's human heart no human heart is denied of that empathy no religion can demolish that by indoctrination no culture no nation and nationalism [UNK] nothing can touch it because it is empathy and that capacity to empathize is the window through which you reach out to people you do something that makes a difference in somebody 's life [UNK] even words even time compassion is not defined in one form there 's no indian compassion there 's no american compassion it transcends nation the gender the age why because it is there in everybody it 's experienced by people occasionally then this occasional compassion we are not talking about [UNK] it will never remain occasional by mandate you can not make a person compassionate you ca n't say " please love me " love is something you discover it 's not an action but in the english language it is also an action i will come to it later so one has got to discover a certain wholeness i am going to cite the possibility of being whole which is within our experience everybody 's experience in spite of a very tragic life one is happy in moments which are very few and far between and the one who is happy even for a slapstick joke accepts himself and also the scheme of things in which one finds oneself that means the whole universe known things and unknown things all of them are totally accepted because you discover your wholeness in yourself the subject [UNK] " me " [UNK] and the object [UNK] the scheme of things [UNK] fuse into oneness an experience nobody can say " i am denied of " an experience common to all and sundry that experience confirms that in spite of all your limitations [UNK] all your wants desires unfulfilled and the credit cards and layoffs and finally baldness [UNK] you can be happy but the extension of the logic is that you do n't need to fulfill your desire to be happy you are the very happiness the wholeness that you want to be there 's no choice in this that only confirms the reality that the wholeness can not be different from you can not be minus you it has got to be you you can not be a part of wholeness and still be whole your moment of happiness reveals that reality that realization that recognition " maybe i am the whole maybe the swami is right maybe the swami is right " you start your new life then everything becomes meaningful i have no more reason to blame myself if one has to blame oneself one has a million reasons plus many but if i say in spite of my body being limited [UNK] if it is black it is not white if it is white it is not black body is limited any which way you look at it limited your knowledge is limited health is limited and power is therefore limited and the cheerfulness is going to be limited compassion is going to be limited everything is going to be limitless you can not command compassion unless you become limitless and nobody can become limitless either you are or you are not period and there is no way of your being not limitless too your own experience reveals in spite of all limitations you are the whole and the wholeness is the reality of you when you relate to the world it is love first when you relate to the world the dynamic manifestation of the wholeness is what we say love and itself becomes compassion if the object that you relate to evokes that emotion then that again transforms into giving into sharing you express yourself because you have compassion to discover compassion you need to be compassionate to discover the capacity to give and share you need to be giving and sharing there is no shortcut it is like swimming by swimming you learn swimming by swimming you can not learn swimming on a foam mattress and enter into water you learn swimming by swimming you learn cycling by cycling you learn cooking by cooking having some sympathetic people around you to eat what you cook and therefore what i say you have to fake it and make it you need to my predecessor meant that you have to act it out you have to act compassionately there is no verb for compassion but you have an adverb for compassion that 's interesting to me you act compassionately but then how to act compassionately if you do n't have compassion that is where you fake you fake it and make it this is the mantra of the united states of america you fake it and make it you act compassionately as though you have compassion grind your teeth take all the support system if you know how to pray pray ask for compassion let me act compassionately do it you 'll discover compassion and also slowly a relative compassion and slowly perhaps if you get the right teaching you 'll discover compassion is a dynamic manifestation of the reality of yourself which is oneness wholeness and that 's what you are with these words thank you very much .i thought i would think about changing your perspective on the world a bit and showing you some of the designs that we have in nature and so i have my first slide to talk about the dawning of the universe and what i call the cosmic scene investigation that is looking at the relics of creation and inferring what happened at the beginning and then following it up and trying to understand it and so one of the questions that i asked you is when you look around what do you see well you see this space that 's created by designers and by the work of people but what you actually see is a lot of material that was already here being reshaped in a certain form and so the question is how did that material get here how did it get into the form that it had before it got reshaped and so forth it 's a question of what 's the continuity so one of the things i look at is how did the universe begin and shape what was the whole process in the creation and the evolution of the universe to getting to the point that we have these kinds of materials so that 's sort of the part and let me move on then and show you the hubble ultra deep field if you look at this picture what you will see is a lot of dark with some light objects in it and everything but [UNK] four of these light objects are stars and you can see them there [UNK] little pluses this is a star this is a star everything else is a galaxy ok so there 's a couple of thousand galaxies you can see easily with your eye in here and when i look out at particularly this galaxy which looks a lot like ours i wonder if there 's an art design college conference going on and intelligent beings there are thinking about you know what designs they might do and there might be a few cosmologists trying to understand where the universe itself came from and there might even be some in that galaxy looking at ours trying to figure out what 's going on over here but there 's a lot of other galaxies and some are nearby and they 're kind of the color of the sun and some are further away and they 're a little bluer and so forth but one of the questions is [UNK] this should be to you [UNK] how come there are so many galaxies because this represents a very clean fraction of the sky this is only 1,000 galaxies we think there 's on the order [UNK] visible to the hubble space telescope if you had the time to scan it around [UNK] about 100 billion galaxies right it 's a very large number of galaxies and that 's roughly how many stars there are in our own galaxy but when you look at some of these regions like this you 'll see more galaxies than stars which is kind of a conundrum so the question should come to your mind is what kind of design you know what kind of creative process and what kind of design produced the world like that and then i 'm going to show you it 's actually a lot more complicated we 're going to try and follow it up we have a tool that actually helps us out in this study and that 's the fact that the universe is so incredibly big that it 's a time machine in a certain sense we draw this set of nested spheres cut away so you see it put the earth at the center of the nested spheres just because that 's where we 're making observations and the moon is only two seconds away so if you take a picture of the moon using ordinary light it 's the moon two seconds ago and who cares two seconds is like the present the sun is eight minutes ago that 's not such a big deal right unless there 's solar flares coming then you want to get out the way you 'd like to have a little advance warning but you get out to jupiter and it 's 40 minutes away it 's a problem you hear about mars it 's a problem communicating to mars because it takes light long enough to go there but if you look out to the nearest set of stars to the nearest 40 or 50 stars it 's about 10 years so if you take a picture of what 's going on it 's 10 years ago but you go and look to the center of the galaxy it 's thousands of years ago if you look at andromeda which is the nearest big galaxy and it 's two million years ago if you took a picture of the earth two million years ago there 'd be no evidence of humans at all because we do n't think there were humans yet i mean it just gives you the scale with the hubble space telescope we 're looking at hundreds of millions of years to a billion years but if we were capable to come up with an idea of how to look even further [UNK] there 's some things even further and that was what i did in a lot of my work was to develop the techniques [UNK] we could look out back to even earlier epochs before there were stars and before there were galaxies back to when the universe was hot and dense and very different and so that 's the sort of sequence and so i have a more artistic impression of this there 's the galaxy in the middle which is the milky way and around that are the hubble [UNK] you know nearby kind of galaxies and there 's a sphere that marks the different times and behind that are some more modern galaxies you see the whole big picture the beginning of time is funny [UNK] it 's on the outside right and then there 's a part of the universe we ca n't see because it 's so dense and so hot light ca n't escape it 's like you ca n't see to the center of the sun you have to use other techniques to know what 's going on inside the sun but you can see the edge of the sun and the universe gets that way and you can see that and then you see this sort of model area around the outside and that is the radiation coming from the big bang which is actually incredibly uniform the universe is almost a perfect sphere but there are these very tiny variations which we show here in great exaggeration and from them in the time sequence we 're going to have to go from these tiny variations to these irregular galaxies and first stars to these more advanced galaxies and eventually the solar system and so forth so it 's a big design job but we 'll see about how things are going on so the way these measurements were done there 's been a set of satellites and this is where you get to see so there was the cobe satellite which was launched in 1989 and we discovered these variations and then in 2000 the map satellite was launched [UNK] the wmap [UNK] and it made somewhat better pictures and later this year [UNK] this is the cool stealth version the one that actually has some beautiful design features to it and you should look [UNK] the planck satellite will be launched and it will make very high-resolution maps and that will be the sequence of understanding the very beginning of the universe and what we saw was we saw these variations and then they told us the secrets both about the structure of space-time and about the contents of the universe and about how the universe started in its original motions so we have this picture which is quite a spectacular picture and i 'll come back to the beginning where we 're going to have some mysterious process that kicks the universe off at the beginning and we go through a period of accelerating expansion and the universe expands and cools until it gets to the point where it becomes transparent then to the dark ages and then the first stars turn on and they evolve into galaxies and then later they get to the more expansive galaxies and somewhere around this period is when our solar system started forming and it 's maturing up to the present time and there 's some spectacular things and this wastebasket part that 's to represent what the structure of space-time itself is doing during this period and so this is a pretty weird model right what kind of evidence do we have for that so let me show you some of nature 's patterns that are the result of this i always think of space-time as being the real substance of space and the galaxies and the stars just like the foam on the ocean it 's a marker of where the interesting waves are and whatever went on so here is the sloan digital sky survey showing the location of a million galaxies so there 's a dot on here for every galaxy they go out and point a telescope at the sky take a picture identify what are stars and throw them away look at the galaxies estimate how far away they are and plot them up and just put radially they 're going out that way and you see these structures this thing we call the great wall but there are voids and those kinds of stuff and they kind of fade out because the telescope is n't sensitive enough to do it now i 'm going to show you this in 3d what happens is you take pictures as the earth rotates you get a fan across the sky there are some places you ca n't look because of our own galaxy or because there are no telescopes available to do it so the next picture shows you the three-dimensional version of this rotating around do you see the fan-like scans made across the sky remember every spot on here is a galaxy and you see the galaxies you know sort of in our neighborhood and you sort of see the structure and you see this thing we call the great wall and you see the complicated structure and you see these voids there are places where there are no galaxies and there are places where there are thousands of galaxies clumped together right so there 's an interesting pattern but we do n't have enough data here to actually see the pattern we only have a million galaxies right so we 're keeping like a million balls in the air but what 's going on there 's another survey which is very similar to this called the two-degree field of view galaxy redshift survey now we 're going to fly through it at warp a million and every time there 's a galaxy [UNK] at its location there 's a galaxy [UNK] and if we know anything about the galaxy which we do because there 's a redshift measurement and everything you put in the type of galaxy and the color so this is the real representation and when you 're in the middle of the galaxies it 's hard to see the pattern it 's like being in the middle of life it 's hard to see the pattern in the middle of the audience it 's hard to see the pattern of this so we 're going to go out and swing around and look back at this and you 'll see first the structure of the survey and then you 'll start seeing the structure of the galaxies that we see out there so again you can see the extension of this great wall of galaxies showing up here but you can see the voids you can see the complicated structure and you say well how did this happen suppose you 're the cosmic designer how are you going to put galaxies out there in a pattern like that it 's not just throwing them out at random there 's a more complicated process going on here how are you going to end up doing that and so now we 're in for some serious play that is we have to seriously play god not just change people 's lives but make the universe right so if that 's your responsibility how are you going to do that what 's the kind of technique what 's the kind of thing you 're going to do so i 'm going to show you the results of a very large-scale simulation of what we think the universe might be like using essentially some of the play principles and some of the design principles that you know humans have labored so hard to pick up but apparently nature knew how to do at the beginning and that is you start out with very simple ingredients and some simple rules but you have to have enough ingredients to make it complicated and then you put in some randomness some fluctuations and some randomness and realize a whole bunch of different representations so what i 'm going to do is show you the distribution of matter as a function of scales we 're going to zoom in but this is a plot of what it is and we had to add one more thing to make the universe come out right it 's called dark matter that is matter that does n't interact with light the typical way that ordinary matter does the way the light 's shining on me or on the stage it 's transparent to light but in order for you to see it we 're going to make it white ok so the stuff that 's in this picture that 's white that is the dark matter it should be called invisible matter but the dark matter we 've made visible and the stuff that is in the yellow color that is the ordinary kind of matter that 's turned into stars and galaxies so i 'll show you the next movie so this [UNK] we 're going to zoom in notice this pattern and pay attention to this pattern we 're going to zoom in and zoom in and you 'll see there are all these filaments and structures and voids and when a number of filaments come together in a knot that makes a supercluster of galaxies this one we 're zooming in on is somewhere between 100,000 and a million galaxies in that small region so we live in the boonies we do n't live in the center of the solar system we do n't live in the center of the galaxy and our galaxy 's not in the center of the cluster so we 're zooming in this is a region which probably has more than 100,000 on the order of a million galaxies in that region we 're going to keep zooming in ok and so i forgot to tell you the scale a parsec is 3.26 light years so a gigaparsec is three billion light years [UNK] that 's the scale so it takes light three billion years to travel over that distance now we 're into a distance sort of between here and here that 's the distance between us and andromeda right these little specks that you 're seeing in here they 're galaxies now we 're going to zoom back out and you can see this structure that when we get very far out looks very regular but it 's made up of a lot of irregular variations so they 're simple building blocks there 's a very simple fluid to begin with it 's got dark matter it 's got ordinary matter it 's got photons and it 's got neutrinos which do n't play much role in the later part of the universe and it 's just a simple fluid and it over time develops into this complicated structure and so you know when you first saw this picture it did n't mean quite so much to you here you 're looking across one percent of the volume of the visible universe and you 're seeing billions of galaxies right and nodes but you realize they 're not even the main structure there 's a framework which is the dark matter the invisible matter that 's out there that 's actually holding it all together so let 's fly through it and you can see how much harder it is when you 're in the middle of something to figure this out so here 's that same end result you see a filament you see the light is the invisible matter and the yellow is the stars or the galaxies showing up and we 're going to fly around and we 'll fly around and you 'll see occasionally a couple of filaments intersect and you get a large cluster of galaxies and then we 'll fly in to where the very large cluster is and you can see what it looks like and so from inside it does n't look very complicated right it 's only when you look at it at a very large scale and explore it and so forth you realize it 's a very intricate complicated kind of a design right and it 's grown up in some kind of way so the question is how hard would it be to assemble this right how big a contractor team would you need to put this universe together right that 's the issue right and so here we are you see how the filament [UNK] you see how several filaments are coming together therefore making this supercluster of galaxies and you have to understand this is not how it would actually look if you [UNK] first you ca n't travel this fast everything would be distorted but this is using simple rendering and graphic arts kind of stuff this is how if you took billions of years to go around it might look to you right and if you could see invisible matter too and so the idea is you know how would you put together the universe in a very simple way we 're going to start and realize that the entire visible universe everything we can see in every direction with the hubble space telescope plus our other instruments was once in a region that was smaller than an atom it started with tiny quantum mechanical fluctuations but expanding at a tremendous rate and those fluctuations were stretched to astronomical sizes and those fluctuations eventually are the things we see in the cosmic microwave background and then we needed some way to turn those fluctuations into galaxies and clusters of galaxies and make these kinds of structures go on so i 'm going to show you a smaller simulation this simulation was run on 1,000 processors for a month in order to make just this simple visible one so i 'm going to show you one that can be run on a desktop in two days in the next picture so you start out with teeny fluctuations when the universe was at this point now four times smaller and so forth and you start seeing these networks this cosmic web of structure forming and this is a simple one because it does n't have the ordinary matter and it just has the dark matter in it and you see how the dark matter lumps up and the ordinary matter just trails along behind so there it is at the beginning it 's very uniform the fluctuations are a part in 100,000 there are a few peaks that are a part in 10,000 and then over billions of years gravity just pulls in this is light over density pulls the material around in that pulls in more material and pulls in more material but the distances on the universe are so large and the time scales are so large that it takes a long time for this to form and it keeps forming until the universe is roughly about half the size it is now in terms of its expansion and at that point the universe mysteriously starts accelerating its expansion and cuts off the formation of larger-scale structure so we 're just seeing as large a scale structure as we can see and then only things that have started forming already are going to form and then from then on it 's going to go on so we 're able to do the simulation but this is two days on a desktop we need you know 30 days on 1,000 processors to do the kind of simulation that i showed you before so we have an idea of how to play seriously creating the universe by starting with essentially less than an eyedrop full of material and we create everything we can see in any direction right from almost nothing [UNK] that is something extremely tiny extremely small [UNK] and it is almost perfect except it has these tiny fluctuations at a part in 100,000 level which turn out to produce the interesting patterns and designs we see that is galaxies and stars and so forth so we have a model and we can calculate it and we can use it to make designs of what we think the universe really looks like and that design is sort of way beyond what our original imagination ever was so this is what we started with 15 years ago with the cosmic background explorer [UNK] made the map on the upper right which basically showed us that there were large-scale fluctuations and actually fluctuations on several scales you can kind of see that since then we 've had wmap which just gives us higher angular resolution we see the same large-scale structure but we see additional small-scale structure and on the bottom right is if the satellite had flipped upside down and mapped the earth what kind of a map we would have got of the earth you can see well you can kind of pick out all the major continents but that 's about it but what we 're hoping when we get to planck we 'll have resolution about equivalent to the resolution you see of the earth there where you can really see the complicated pattern that exists on the earth and you can also tell because of the sharp edges and the way things fit together there are some non-linear processes geology has these effects which is moving the plates around and so forth you can see that just from the map alone we want to get to the point in our maps of the early universe we can see whether there are any non-linear effects that are starting to move to modify and are giving us a hint about how space-time itself was actually created at the beginning moments so that 's where we are today and that 's what i wanted to give you a flavor of give you a different view about what the design and what everything else looks like thank you .we 've been told to go out on a limb and say something surprising so i 'll try and do that but i want to start with two things that everyone already knows and the first one in fact is something that has been known for most of recorded history and that is that the planet earth or the solar system or our environment or whatever is uniquely suited to sustain our evolution [UNK] or creation as it used to be thought [UNK] and our present existence and most important our future survival nowadays this idea has a dramatic name spaceship earth and the idea there is that outside the spaceship the universe is implacably hostile and inside is all we have all we depend on and we only get the one chance if we mess up our spaceship we 've got nowhere else to go now the second thing that everyone already knows is that contrary to what was believed for most of human history human beings are not in fact the hub of existence as stephen hawking famously said we 're just a chemical scum on the surface of a typical planet that 's in orbit around a typical star which is on the outskirts of a typical galaxy and so on now the first of those two things that everyone knows is kind of saying that we 're at a very un-typical place uniquely suited and so on and the second one is saying that we 're at a typical place and especially if you regard these two as deep truths to live by and to inform your life decisions then they seem a little bit to conflict with each other but that does n't prevent them from both being completely false and they are so let me start with the second one typical well [UNK] is this a typical place well let 's look around you know and look in a random direction and we see a wall and chemical scum [UNK] [UNK] and that 's not typical of the universe at all all you 've got to do is go a few hundred miles in that same direction and look back and you wo n't see any walls or chemical scum at all [UNK] all you see is a blue planet and if you go further than that you 'll see the sun the solar system and the stars and so on but that 's still not typical of the universe because stars come in galaxies and most places in the universe a typical place in the universe is nowhere near any galaxies so let 's go out further till we 're outside the galaxy and look back and yeah there 's the huge galaxy with spiral arms laid out in front of us and at this point we 've come 100,000 light years from here but we 're still nowhere near a typical place in the universe to get to a typical place you 've got to go 1,000 times as far as that into intergalactic space and so what does that look like typical what does a typical place in the universe look like well at enormous expense ted has arranged a high-resolution immersion virtual reality rendering of intergalactic space [UNK] the view from intergalactic space so can we have the lights off please so we can see it well not quite not quite perfect [UNK] you see in intergalactic space [UNK] intergalactic space is completely dark pitch dark it 's so dark that if you were to be looking at the nearest star to you and that star were to explode as a supernova and you were to be staring directly at it at the moment when its light reached you you still would n't be able to see even a glimmer that 's how big and how dark the universe is and that 's despite the fact that a supernova is so bright so brilliant an event that it would kill you stone dead at a range of several light years and yet from intergalactic space it 's so far away you would n't even see it it 's also very cold out there [UNK] less than three degrees above absolute zero and it 's very empty the vacuum there is one million times less dense than the highest vacuum that our best technology on earth can currently create so that 's how different a typical place is from this place and that is how un-typical this place is so can we have the lights back on please thank you now how do we know about an environment that 's so far away and so different and so alien from anything we 're used to well the earth [UNK] our environment in the form of us [UNK] is creating knowledge well what does that mean well look out even further than we 've just been [UNK] i mean from here with a telescope [UNK] and you 'll see things that look like stars they 're called " quasars " quasars originally meant quasi-stellar object which means things that look a bit like stars but they 're not stars and we know what they are billions of years ago and billions of light years away the material at the center of a galaxy collapsed towards a super-massive black hole and then intense magnetic fields directed some of the energy of that gravitational collapse and some of the matter back out in the form of tremendous jets which illuminated lobes with the brilliance of [UNK] i think it 's a trillion suns now the physics of the human brain could hardly be more unlike the physics of such a jet we could n't survive for an instant in it language breaks down when trying to describe what it would be like in one of those jets it would be a bit like experiencing a supernova explosion but at point-blank range and for millions of years at a time and yet that jet happened in precisely such a way that billions of years later on the other side of the universe some bit of chemical scum could accurately describe and model and predict and explain above all [UNK] there 's your reference [UNK] what was happening there in reality the one physical system the brain contains an accurate working model of the other [UNK] the quasar not just a superficial image of it though it contains that as well but an explanatory model embodying the same mathematical relationships and the same causal structure now that is knowledge and if that were n't amazing enough the faithfulness with which the one structure resembles the other is increasing with time that is the growth of knowledge so the laws of physics have this special property that physical objects as unlike each other as they could possibly be can nevertheless embody the same mathematical and causal structure and to do it more and more so over time so we are a chemical scum that is different this chemical scum has universality its structure contains with ever-increasing precision the structure of everything this place and not other places in the universe is a hub which contains within itself the structural and causal essence of the whole of the rest of physical reality and so far from being insignificant the fact that the laws of physics allow this or even mandate that this can happen is one of the most important things about the physical world now how does the solar system [UNK] and our environment in the form of us [UNK] acquire this special relationship with the rest of the universe well one thing that 's true about stephen hawking 's remark [UNK] i mean it is true but it 's the wrong emphasis one thing that 's true about it is that it does n't do it with any special physics there 's no special dispensation no miracles involved it does it simply with three things that we have here in abundance one of them is matter because the growth of knowledge is a form of information processing information processing is computation computation requires a computer [UNK] there 's no known way of making a computer without matter we also need energy to make the computer and most important to make the media in effect onto which we record the knowledge that we discover and then thirdly less tangible but just as essential for the open-ended creation of knowledge of explanations is evidence now our environment is inundated with evidence we happen to get round to testing let 's say newton 's law of gravity about 300 years ago but the evidence that we used to do that was falling down on every square meter of the earth for billions of years before that and will continue to fall on for billions of years afterwards and the same is true for all the other sciences as far as we know evidence to discover the most fundamental truths of all the sciences is here just for the taking on our planet our location is saturated with evidence and also with matter and energy out in intergalactic space those three prerequisites for the open-ended creation of knowledge are at their lowest possible supply as i said it 's empty it 's cold and it 's dark out there or is it now actually that 's just another parochial misconception because imagine a cube out there in intergalactic space the same size as our home the solar system now that cube is very empty by human standards but that still means that it contains over a million tons of matter and a million tons is enough to make say a self-contained space station on which there 's a colony of scientists that are devoted to creating an open-ended stream of knowledge and so on now it 's way beyond present technology to even gather the hydrogen from intergalactic space and form it into other elements and so on but the thing is in a comprehensible universe if something is n't forbidden by the laws of physics then what could possibly prevent us from doing it other than knowing how in other words it 's a matter of knowledge not resources and the same [UNK] well if we could do that we 'd automatically have an energy supply because the transmutation would be a fusion reactor [UNK] and evidence well again it 's dark out there to human senses but all you 've got to do is take a telescope even one of present-day design look out and you 'll see the same galaxies as we do from here and with a more powerful telescope you 'll be able to see stars and planets in those galaxies you 'll be able to do astrophysics and learn the laws of physics and locally there you could build particle accelerators and learn elementary particle physics and chemistry and so on probably the hardest science to do would be biology field trips [UNK] [UNK] because it would take several hundred million years to get to the nearest life-bearing planet and back but i have to tell you [UNK] and sorry richard [UNK] but i never did like biology field trips much and i think we can just about make do with one every few hundred million years so in fact intergalactic space does contain all the prerequisites for the open-ended creation of knowledge any such cube anywhere in the universe could become the same kind of hub that we are if the knowledge of how to do so were present there so we 're not in a uniquely hospitable place if intergalactic space is capable of creating an open-ended stream of explanations then so is almost every other environment so is the earth so is a polluted earth and the limiting factor there and here is not resources because they 're plentiful but knowledge which is scarce now this cosmic knowledge-based view may [UNK] and i think ought to [UNK] make us feel very special but it should also make us feel vulnerable because it means that without the specific knowledge that 's needed to survive the ongoing challenges of the universe we wo n't survive them all it takes is for a supernova to go off a few light years away and we 'll all be dead 1 martin rees has recently written a book about our vulnerability to all sorts of things from astrophysics to scientific experiments gone wrong and most importantly to terrorism with weapons of mass destruction and he thinks that civilization has only a 50 percent chance of surviving this century i think he 's going to talk about that later in the conference now i do n't think that probability is the right category to discuss this issue in but i do agree with him about this we can survive and we can fail to survive but it depends not on chance but on whether we create the relevant knowledge in time the danger is not at all unprecedented species go extinct all the time civilizations end the overwhelming majority of all species and all civilizations that have ever existed are now history and if we want to be the exception to that then logically our only hope is to make use of the one feature that distinguishes our species and our civilization from all the others [UNK] namely our special relationship with the laws of physics our ability to create new explanations new knowledge [UNK] to be a hub of existence so let me now apply this to a current controversy not because i want to advocate any particular solution but just to illustrate the kind of thing i mean and the controversy is global warming now i 'm a physicist but i 'm not the right kind of physicist in regard to global warming i 'm just a layman and the rational thing for a layman to do is to take seriously the prevailing scientific theory and according to that theory it 's already too late to avoid a disaster because if it 's true that our best option at the moment is to prevent co2 emissions with something like the kyoto protocol with its constraints on economic activity and its enormous cost of hundreds of billions of dollars or whatever it is then that is already a disaster by any reasonable measure and the actions that are advocated are not even purported to solve the problem merely to postpone it by a little so it 's already too late to avoid it and it probably has been too late to avoid it ever since before anyone realized the danger it was probably already too late in the 1970s when the best available scientific theory was telling us that industrial emissions were about to precipitate a new ice age in which billions would die now the lesson of that seems clear to me and i do n't know why it is n't informing public debate it is that we ca n't always know when we know of an impending disaster and how to solve it at a cost less than the cost of the disaster itself then there 's not going to be much argument really but no precautions and no precautionary principle can avoid problems that we do not yet foresee hence we need a stance of problem-fixing not just problem-avoidance and it 's true that an ounce of prevention equals a pound of cure but that 's only if we know what to prevent if you 've been punched on the nose then the science of medicine does not consist of teaching you how to avoid punches if medical science stopped seeking cures and concentrated on prevention only then it would achieve very little of either the world is buzzing at the moment with plans to force reductions in gas emissions at all costs it ought to be buzzing with plans to reduce the temperature and with plans to live at the higher temperature [UNK] and not at all costs but efficiently and cheaply and some such plans exist things like swarms of mirrors in space to deflect the sunlight away and encouraging aquatic organisms to eat more carbon dioxide at the moment these things are fringe research they 're not central to the human effort to face this problem or problems in general and with problems that we are not aware of yet the ability to put right [UNK] not the sheer good luck of avoiding indefinitely [UNK] is our only hope not just of solving problems but of survival so take two stone tablets and carve on them on one of them carve " problems are soluble " and on the other one carve " problems are inevitable " thank you .i 'm going to tell you a little bit about my tedxhouston talk i woke up the morning after i gave that talk with the worst vulnerability hangover of my life and i actually did n't leave my house for about three days the first time i left was to meet a friend for lunch and when i walked in she was already at the table and i sat down and she said " god you look like hell " i said " thanks i feel really [UNK] i 'm not functioning " and she said " what 's going on " and i said " i just told 500 people that i became a researcher to avoid vulnerability and that when being vulnerable emerged from my data as absolutely essential to whole-hearted living i told these 500 people that i had a breakdown i had a slide that said breakdown at what point did i think that was a good idea " and she said " i saw your talk live-streamed it was not really you it was a little different than what you usually do but it was great " and i said " this ca n't happen youtube they 're putting this thing on youtube and we 're going to be talking about 600 700 people " and she said " well i think it 's too late " and i said " let me ask you something " and she said " yeah " and i said " do you remember when we were in college and really wild and kind of dumb " and she said " yeah " and i said " remember when we 'd leave a really bad message on our ex-boyfriend 's answering machine then we 'd have to break into his dorm room and then erase the tape " and she goes " uh 1 no " so of course the only thing i could think of to say at that point was " yeah me neither that 1 me neither " and i 'm thinking to myself " brene what are you doing what are you doing why did you bring this up have you lost your mind your sisters would be perfect for this " so i looked back up and she said " are you really going to try to break in and steal the video before they put it on youtube " and i said " i 'm just thinking about it a little bit " she said " you 're like the worst vulnerability role model ever " and then i looked at her and i said something that at the time felt a little dramatic but ended up being more prophetic than dramatic i said " if 500 turns into 1,000 or 2,000 my life is over " i had no contingency plan for four million and my life did end when that happened and maybe the hardest part about my life ending is that i learned something hard about myself and that was that as much as i would frustrated about not being able to get my work out to the world there was a part of me that was working very hard to engineer staying small staying right under the radar but i want to talk about what i 've learned there 's two things that i 've learned in the last year the first is vulnerability is not weakness and that myth is profoundly dangerous let me ask you honestly [UNK] and i 'll give you this warning i 'm trained as a therapist so i can out-wait you uncomfortably [UNK] so if you could just raise your hand that would be awesome [UNK] how many of you honestly when you 're thinking about doing something vulnerable or saying something vulnerable think " god vulnerability 's weakness this is weakness " how many of you think of vulnerability and weakness synonymously the majority of people now let me ask you this question this past week at ted how many of you when you saw vulnerability up here thought it was pure courage vulnerability is not weakness i define vulnerability as emotional risk exposure uncertainty it fuels our daily lives and i 've come to the belief [UNK] this is my 12th year doing this research [UNK] that vulnerability is our most accurate measurement of courage [UNK] to be vulnerable to let ourselves be seen to be honest one of the weird things that 's happened is after the ted explosion i got a lot of offers to speak all over the country [UNK] everyone from schools and parent meetings to fortune 500 companies and so many of the calls went like this " hey dr. brown we loved your tedtalk we 'd like you to come in and speak we 'd appreciate it if you would n't mention vulnerability or shame " what would you like for me to talk about there 's three big answers this is mostly to be honest with you from the business sector innovation creativity and change so let me go on the record and say vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation creativity and change to create is to make something that has never existed before there 's nothing more vulnerable than that adaptability to change is all about vulnerability the second thing in addition to really finally understanding the relationship between vulnerability and courage the second thing i learned is this we have to talk about shame and i 'm going to be really honest with you when i became a " vulnerability researcher " and that became the focus because of the tedtalk [UNK] and i 'm not kidding i 'll give you an example about three months ago i was in a sporting goods store buying goggles and shin guards and all the things that parents buy at the sporting goods store about from a hundred feet away this is what i hear " vulnerability ted 1 vulnerability ted 1 " i 'm a fifth generation texan our family motto is " lock and load " i am not a natural vulnerability researcher so i 'm like just keep walking she 's on my six and then i hear " vulnerability ted 1 " i turn around i go " hi " she 's right here and she said " you 're the shame researcher who had the breakdown " at this point parents are like pulling their children close " look away " and i 'm so worn out at this point in my life i look at her and i actually say " it was a frickin ' spiritual awakening " and she looks back and does this " i know " and she said " we watched your tedtalk in my book club then we read your book and we renamed ourselves 'the breakdown babes ' " and she said " our tagline is 'we 're falling apart and it feels fantastic ' " you can only imagine what it 's like for me in a faculty meeting so when i became vulnerability ted like an action figure [UNK] like ninja barbie but i 'm vulnerability ted [UNK] i thought i 'm going to leave that shame stuff behind because i spent six years studying shame before i really started writing and talking about vulnerability and i thought thank god because shame is this horrible topic no one wants to talk about it it 's the best way to shut people down on an airplane " what do you do " " i study shame " " oh " and i see you but in surviving this last year i was reminded of a cardinal rule [UNK] not a research rule but a moral imperative from my upbringing [UNK] you 've got to dance with the one who brung ya and i did not learn about vulnerability and courage and creativity and innovation from studying vulnerability i learned about these things from studying shame and so i want to walk you in to shame jungian analysts call shame the swampland of the soul and we 're going to walk in and the purpose is not to walk in and construct a home and live there it is to put on some galoshes and walk through and find our way around here 's why we heard the most compelling call ever to have a conversation in this country and i think globally around race right yes we heard that yes can not have that conversation without shame because you can not talk about race without talking about privilege and when people start talking about privilege they get paralyzed by shame we heard a brilliant simple solution to not killing people in surgery which is have a checklist you ca n't fix that problem without addressing shame because when they teach those folks how to suture they also teach them how to stitch their self-worth to being all-powerful and all-powerful folks do n't need checklists and i had to write down the name of this ted fellow so i did n't mess it up here myshkin ingawale i hope i did right by you i saw the ted fellows my first day here and he got up and he explained how he was driven to create some technology to help test for anemia because people were dying unnecessarily and he said " i saw this need so you know what i did i made it " and everybody just burst into applause and they were like " yes 1 " and he said " and it did n't work and then i made it 32 more times and then it worked " you know what the big secret about ted is i ca n't wait to tell people this i guess i 'm doing it right now this is like the failure conference no it is you know why this place is amazing because very few people here are afraid to fail and no one who gets on the stage so far that i 've seen has not failed i 've failed miserably many times i do n't think the world understands that because of shame there 's a great quote that saved me this past year by theodore roosevelt a lot of people refer to it as the " man in the arena " quote and it goes like this " it is not the critic who counts it is not the man who sits and points out how the doer of deeds could have done things better and how he falls and stumbles the credit goes to the man in the arena whose face is marred with dust and blood and sweat but when he 's in the arena at best he wins and at worst he loses but when he fails when he loses he does so daring greatly " and that 's what this conference to me is about that 's what life is about about daring greatly about being in the arena when you walk up to that arena and you put your hand on the door and you think " i 'm going in and i 'm going to try this " shame is the gremlin who says " uh uh you 're not good enough you never finished that mba your wife left you i know your dad really was n't in luxembourg he was in sing sing i know those things that happened to you growing up i know you do n't think that you 're pretty enough or smart enough or talented enough or powerful enough i know your dad never paid attention even when you made cfo " shame is that thing and if we can quiet it down and walk in and say " i 'm going to do this " we look up and the critic that we see pointing and laughing 99 percent of the time is who us shame drives two big tapes [UNK] " never good enough " and if you can talk it out of that one " who do you think you are " the thing to understand about shame is it 's not guilt shame is a focus on self guilt is a focus on behavior shame is " i am bad " guilt is " i did something bad " how many of you if you did something that was hurtful to me would be willing to say " i 'm sorry i made a mistake " how many of you would be willing to say that guilt i 'm sorry i made a mistake shame i 'm sorry i am a mistake there 's a huge difference between shame and guilt and here 's what you need to know shame is highly highly correlated with addiction depression violence aggression bullying suicide eating disorders and here 's what you even need to know more guilt inversely correlated with those things the ability to hold something we 've done or failed to do up against who we want to be is incredibly adaptive it 's uncomfortable but it 's adaptive the other thing you need to know about shame is it 's absolutely organized by gender if shame washes over me and washes over chris it 's going to feel the same everyone sitting in here knows the warm wash of shame we 're pretty sure that the only people who do n't experience shame are people who have no capacity for connection or empathy which means yes i have a little shame no i 'm a sociopath so i would opt for yes you have a little shame shame feels the same for men and women but it 's organized by gender for women the best example i can give you is enjoli the commercial " i can put the wash on the line pack the lunches hand out the kisses and be at work at five to nine i can bring home the bacon fry it up in the pan and never let you forget you 're a man " for women shame is do it all do it perfectly and never let them see you sweat i do n't know how much perfume that commercial sold but i guarantee you it moved a lot of antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds shame for women is this web of unobtainable conflicting competing expectations about who we 're supposed to be and it 's a straight-jacket for men shame is not a bunch of competing conflicting expectations shame is one do not be perceived as what weak i did not interview men for the first four years of my study and it was n't until a man looked at me one day after a book signing said " i love what you have to say about shame i 'm curious why you did n't mention men " and i said " i do n't study men " and he said " that 's convenient " and i said " why " and he said " because you say to reach out tell our story be vulnerable but you see those books you just signed for my wife and my three daughters " i said " yeah " " they 'd rather me die on top of my white horse than watch me fall down when we reach out and be vulnerable we get the shit beat out of us and do n't tell me it 's from the guys and the coaches and the dads because the women in my life are harder on me than anyone else " so i started interviewing men and asking questions and what i learned is this you show me a woman who can actually sit with a man in real vulnerability and fear i 'll show you a woman who 's done incredible work you show me a man who can sit with a woman who 's just had it she ca n't do it all anymore and his first response is not " i unloaded the dishwasher " but he really listens [UNK] because that 's all we need [UNK] i 'll show you a guy who 's done a lot of work shame is an epidemic in our culture and to get out from underneath it to find our way back to each other we have to understand how it affects us and how it affects the way we 're parenting the way we 're working the way we 're looking at each other very quickly some research by mahalik at boston college he asked what do women need to do to conform to female norms the top answers in this country nice thin modest and use all available resources for appearance when he asked about men what do men in this country need to do to conform with male norms the answers were always show emotional control work is first pursue status and violence if we 're going to find our way back to each other we have to understand and know empathy because empathy 's the antidote to shame if you put shame in a petri dish it needs three things to grow exponentially secrecy silence and judgment if you put the same amount of shame in a petri dish and douse it with empathy it ca n't survive the two most powerful words when we 're in struggle me too and so i 'll leave you with this thought if we 're going to find our way back to each other vulnerability is going to be that path and i know it 's seductive to stand outside the arena because i think i did it my whole life and think to myself i 'm going to go in there and kick some ass when i 'm bulletproof and when i 'm perfect and that is seductive but the truth is that never happens and even if you got as perfect as you could and as bulletproof as you could possibly muster when you got in there that 's not what we want to see we want you to go in we want to be with you and across from you and we just want for ourselves and the people we care about and the people we work with to dare greatly so thank you all very much i really appreciate it .a talk about surgical robots is also a talk about surgery and while i 've tried to make my images not too graphic keep in mind that surgeons have a different relationship with blood than normal people do because after all what a surgeon does to a patient if it were done without consent would be a felony surgeons are the tailors the plumbers the carpenters [UNK] some would say the butchers [UNK] of the medical world cutting reshaping reforming bypassing fixing but you need to talk about surgical instruments and the evolution of surgical technology together so in order to give you some kind of a perspective of where we are right now with surgical robots and where we 're going to be going in the future i want to give you a little bit of perspective of how we got to this point how we even came to believe that surgery was ok that this was something that was possible to do that this kind of cutting and reforming was ok so a little bit of perspective [UNK] about 10,000 years of perspective this is a trephinated skull and trephination is simply just cutting a hole in the skull and many many hundreds of skulls like this have been found in archaeological sites all over the world dating back five to 10 thousand years five to 10 thousand years 1 now imagine this you are a healer in a stone age village and you have some guy that you 're not quite sure what 's wrong with him [UNK] oliver sacks is going to be born way in the future he 's got some seizure disorder and you do n't understand this but you think to yourself " i 'm not quite sure what 's wrong with this guy but maybe if i cut a hole in his head i can fix it " now that is surgical thinking now we 've got the dawn of interventional surgery here what is astonishing about this is even though we do n't know really how much of this was intended to be religious or how much of it was intended to be therapeutic what we can tell is that these patients lived 1 judging by the healing on the borders of these holes they lived days months years following trephination and so what we are seeing is evidence of a refined technique that was being handed down over thousands and thousands of years all over the world this arose independently at sites everywhere that had no communication to one another we really are seeing the dawn of interventional surgery now we can fast forward many thousands of years into the bronze age and beyond and we see new refined tools coming out but surgeons in these eras are a little bit more conservative than their bold trephinating ancestors these guys confined their surgery to fairly superficial injuries and surgeons were tradesmen rather than physicians this persisted all the way into and through the renaissance that may have saved the writers but it did n't really save the surgeons terribly much they were still a mistrusted lot surgeons still had a bit of a pr problem because the landscape was dominated by the itinerant barber surgeon these were folks that traveled from village to village town to town doing surgery sort of as a form of performance art because we were in the age before anesthesia the agony of the patient is really as much of the public spectacle as the surgery itself one of the most famous of these guys frere jacques shown here doing a lithotomy [UNK] which is the removal of the bladder stone one of the most invasive surgeries they did at the time [UNK] had to take less than two minutes you had to have quite a flair for the dramatic and be really really quick and so here you see him doing a lithotomy and he is credited with doing over 4,000 of these public surgeries wandering around in europe which is an astonishing number when you think that surgery must have been a last resort i mean who would put themselves through that until anesthesia the absence of sensation with the demonstration of the morton ether inhaler at the mass general in 1847 a whole new era of surgery was ushered in anesthesia gave surgeons the freedom to operate anesthesia gave them the freedom to experiment to start to delve deeper into the body this was truly a revolution in surgery but there was a pretty big problem with this after these very long painstaking operations attempting to cure things they 'd never been able to touch before the patients died they died of massive infection surgery did n't hurt anymore but it killed you pretty quickly and infection would continue to claim a majority of surgical patients until the next big revolution in surgery which was aseptic technique joseph lister was aepsis 's or sterility 's biggest advocate to a very very skeptical bunch of surgeons but eventually they did come around the mayo brothers came out to visit lister in europe and they came back to their american clinic and they said they had learned it was as important to wash your hands before doing surgery something so simple and yet operative mortality dropped profoundly these surgeries were actually now being effective with the patient insensitive to pain and a sterile operating field all bets were off the sky was the limit you could now start doing surgery everywhere on the gut on the liver on the heart on the brain transplantation you could take an organ out of one person you could put it in another person and it would work surgeons did n't have a problem with respectability anymore they had become gods the era of the " big surgeon big incision " had arrived but at quite a cost because they are saving lives but not necessarily quality of life because healthy people do n't usually need surgery and unhealthy people have a very hard time recovering from a cut like that the question had to be asked " well can we do these same surgeries but through little incisions " laparoscopy is doing this kind of surgery surgery with long instruments through small incisions and it really changed the landscape of surgery some of the tools for this had been around for a hundred years but it had only been used as a diagnostic technique until the 1980s when there was changes in camera technologies and things like that that allowed this to be done for real operations so what you see [UNK] this is now the first surgical image [UNK] as we 're coming down the tube this is a new entry into the body it looks very different from what you 're expecting surgery to look like we bring instruments in from two separate cuts in the side and then you can start manipulating tissue within 10 years of the first gallbladder surgeries being done laparoscopically a majority of gallbladder surgeries were being done laparoscopically [UNK] truly a pretty big revolution but there were casualties of this revolution these techniques were a lot harder to learn than people had anticipated the learning curve was very long and during that learning curve the complications went quite a bit higher surgeons had to give up their 3d vision they had to give up their wrists they had to give up intuitive motion in the instruments this surgeon has over 3,000 hours of laparoscopic experience now this is a particularly frustrating placement of the needle but this is hard and one of the reasons why it is so hard is because the external ergonomics are terrible you 've got these long instruments and you 're working off your centerline and the instruments are essentially working backwards so what you need to do to take the capability of your hand and put it on the other side of that small incision is you need to put a wrist on that instrument and so [UNK] i get to talk about robots [UNK] the da vinci robot put just that wrist on the other side of that incision and so here you 're seeing the operation of this wrist and now in contrast to the laparoscopy you can precisely place the needle in your instruments and you can pass it all the way through and follow it in a trajectory and the reason why this becomes so much easier is [UNK] you can see on the bottom [UNK] the hands are making the motions and the instruments are following those motions exactly now what you put between those instruments and those hands is a large fairly complicated robot the surgeon is sitting at a console and controlling the robot with these controllers and the robot is moving these instruments around and powering them down inside the body you have a 3d camera so you get a 3d view and since this was introduced in 1999 a lot of these robots have been out and being used for surgical procedures like a prostatectomy which is a prostate deep in the pelvis and it requires fine dissection and delicate manipulation to be able to get a good surgical outcome you can also sew bypass vessels directly onto a beating heart without cracking the chest this is all done in between the ribs and you can go inside the heart itself and repair the valves from the inside you 've got these technologies [UNK] thank you [UNK] and so you might say " wow this is really cool 1 so smartypants why is n't all surgery being done this way " and there are some reasons some good reasons and cost is one of them i talked about the large complicated robot with all its bells and whistles one of those robots will cost you about as much as a solid gold surgeon more useful than a solid gold surgeon but still it 's a fairly big capital investment but once you 've got it your procedure costs do come down but there are other barriers so something like a prostatectomy [UNK] the prostate is small and it 's in one spot and you can set your robot up very precisely to work in that one spot and so it 's perfect for something like that and in fact if you or anyone you know had their prostate taken out in the last couple of years chances are it was done with one of these systems but if you need to reach more places than just one you need to move the robot and you need to put some new incisions in there and you need to re-set it up and then you need to add some more ports and more and the problem is it gets time-consuming and cumbersome and for that reason there are many surgeries that just are n't being done with the da vinci so we had to ask the question " well how do we fix that " what if we could change it so that we did n't have to re-set up each time we wanted to move somewhere different what if we could bring all the instruments in together in one place how would that change the capabilities of the surgeon and how would that change the experience for the patient now to do that we need to be able to bring a camera and instruments in together through one small tube like that tube you saw in the laparoscopy video or not so coincidentally like a tube like this so what 's going to come out of that tube is the debut of this new technology this new robot that is going to be able to reach anywhere ready so here it comes this is the camera and three instruments and as you see it come out in order to actually be able to do anything useful it ca n't all stay clustered up like this it has to be able to come off of the centerline and then be able to work back toward that centerline he 's a cheeky little devil but what this lets you do is gives you that all-important traction and counter-traction so that you can dissect so that you can sew so that you can do all the things that you need to do all the surgical tasks but it 's all coming in through one incision it 's not so simple but it 's worth it for the freedom that this gives us as we 're going around for the patient however it 's transparent this is all they 're going to see it 's very exciting to think where we get to go with this we get to write the script of the next revolution in surgery as we take these capabilities and we get to go to the next places we get to decide what our new surgeries are going to be and i think to really get the rest of the way in that revolution we need to not just take our hands in in new ways we also need to take our eyes in in new ways we need to see beyond the surface we need to be able to guide what we 're cutting in a much better way this is a cancer surgery one of the problems with this even for surgeons who 've been looking at this a lot is you ca n't see the cancer especially when it 's hidden below the surface and so what we 're starting to do is we 're starting to inject specially designed markers into the bloodstream that will target the cancer it will go bind to the cancer and we can make those markers glow and we can take special cameras and we can look at it now we know where we need to cut even when it 's below the surface we can take these markers and we can inject them in a tumor site and we can follow where they flow out from that tumor site so we can see the first places where that cancer might travel we can inject these dyes into the bloodstream so that when we do a new vessel and we bypass a blockage on the heart we can see if we actually made the connection before we close that patient back up again [UNK] something that we have n't been able to do without radiation before we can light up tumors like this kidney tumor so that you can exactly see where the boundary is between the kidney tumor and the kidney you want to leave behind or the liver tumor and the liver you want to leave behind and we do n't even need to confine ourselves to this macro vision we have flexible microscopic probes that we can bring down into the body and we can look at cells directly i 'm looking at nerves here so these are nerves you see down on the bottom and the microscope probe that 's being held by the robotic hand up at the top so this is all very prototypey at this point but you care about nerves if you are a surgical patient because they let you keep continence bladder control and sexual function after surgery all of which is generally fairly important to the patient so with the combination of these technologies we can reach it all and we can see it all we can heal the disease and we can leave the patient whole and intact and functional afterwards now i 've talked about the patient as if the patient is somehow someone abstract outside this room and that is not the case many of you all of you maybe will at some point or have already faced a diagnosis of cancer or heart disease or some organ dysfunction that 's going to buy you a date with a surgeon and when you get to that point [UNK] i mean these maladies do n't care how many books you 've written how many companies you 've started that nobel prize you have yet to win how much time you planned to spend with your children these maladies come for us all and the prospect i 'm offering you of an easier surgery 1 is that going to make that diagnosis any less terrifying i 'm not sure i really even want it to because facing your own mortality causes a re-evaluation of priorities and a realignment of what your goals are in life unlike anything else and i would never want to deprive you of that epiphany what i want instead is for you to be whole intact and functional enough to go out and save the world after you 've decided you need to do it and that is my vision for your future thank you .you all know this story in the summer of 1950 enrico fermi the italian-american physicist and atomic-pile builder went to lunch at los alamos national laboratory and joined some colleagues there and asked them a question " where is everybody " this confused his colleagues obviously because they were sitting right there with him and then he had to clarify that he was n't talking about them he was talking about the space aliens you see this was only a few years after the supposed flying saucer crash at roswell new mexico and even though that turned out to be nothing nothing at all [UNK] [UNK] merely a downed weather balloon piloted by small hairless men with slits for mouths 1 still america had gone saucer-mad even famous scientists who were eating lunch fermi 's reasoning if i may paraphrase badly is that the universe is so vast that it stands to reason there should be other intelligent life out there and the universe is so old that unless we were the very first civilization ever to evolve we should have some evidence of their existence by now and yet to the best of our knowledge we are alone " where is everybody " asked fermi and his colleagues had no answer fermi then went on with the same blunt logic to disprove fairies sasquatch god the possibility of love [UNK] and thereafter as you know enrico fermi ate alone now i am not a scientist i have never built an atomic pile although i might argue that technically every pile is atomic however with respect i might point out two possibilities that enrico fermi perhaps did not consider one is that the aliens might be very far away perhaps i dare say even on other planets the other possibility [UNK] [UNK] is perhaps enrico fermi himself was an alien think about it is n't it a little convenient that in the midst of the world war out of nowhere suddenly an italian scientist showed up with an amazing new technology that would transform everything in the world and darken the history of the human species forever after and is n't it a little strange that he required no payment for this that he asked for only one thing [UNK] a gift of two healthy sperm whales that 's [UNK] that 's not true but it is strange and if enrico fermi were indeed a space alien would n't he be the first to have tried to convince his fellow scientists that the space aliens are not already here for it is given in certain ufo-ology or ufology circles that the aliens are already here and have been for millennia that they have walked among us in disguise observing us guiding our evolution from ape to man [UNK] if you believe in that sort of thing [UNK] and occasionally kidnapping us in their flying saucers and taking us away to have sex with us in pyramids it 's a difficult theory to discount i think you 'll agree for even in my own life there are memories i have that are difficult to explain [UNK] happenings that are so odd and unaccountably weird that it is difficult to imagine they were not the result of prolonged and frequent contact with aliens throughout my life for how else will you explain the amazing and absolutely true close encounters that i had and will describe to you now encounter one ocean city new jersey 1980 this was the summer when the special edition of " close encounters of the third kind " was released and i went on vacation with my parents to the jersey shore within 12 hours i was horribly sunburned just like richard dreyfuss in the movie and so i spent the rest of the vacation largely sitting outside our little rental house at night the sidewalk still warm from the sun watching the skies for ufos what did i see stars satellites blinking airplanes [UNK] typical sky junk occasionally kids would come and join me and watch but their necks soon got sore and they would go off to the boardwalk to play video games and mingle with humans i was pretty good at the video games i was not very good at the other part so i stayed alone with the cosmos and that 's when it happened an elderly couple came walking down the street i would say they were in their late seventies and i would say that they were on a date because he was wearing a very neat little suit with a yellow tie [UNK] a brown suit and she was wearing a cardigan because it was now fully night and a chill was coming in off the ocean i remember for some reason that they were exactly the same height and then they stopped and the man turned to me and said " what are you looking for flying saucers " you have to admit that 's a pretty boss piece of detective work for an old man on a date but what was stranger still [UNK] and even i realized it at the time as a nine-year-old child [UNK] was that they stopped at all that this old man would interrupt his moonlight stroll with his sweetheart with the precise reason of making fun of a child " oh " he said " little green men " and then his girlfriend joined in too " there 's no such thing as space men " she said " there 's no such thing " and then they both laughed " ha ha ha " i looked around the street was entirely empty i had stopped hearing the sound of the ocean it was as though time had stopped i did not know why they were teasing me i looked into their strangely angry faces and i remember wondering are they wearing rubber masks and what would be behind those rubber masks if they were giant almond-shaped unblinking eyes slits for mouths the old man crooked his finger as though he were firing a gun and then he made laser sounds " kew kew kew [UNK] watch out " and they turned at once and walked away the old man reached out his knobbly claw for the woman 's hand and found it and left me alone now you could describe this as a simple misunderstanding [UNK] a strange encounter among humans maybe it was swamp gas but [UNK] [UNK] i know what i saw close encounter two brookline massachusetts 1984 i went to see the movie " dune " and a girl talked to me now on its face [UNK] [UNK] this is impossible on its face i realize [UNK] but it is absolutely true it was opening night naturally i went with my friend tim mcgonigal who sat on my left on my right was the girl in question she had long curly black hair a blue jean jacket i remember she had some sort of injury to her ankle an ace bandage and she had crutches she was very tall i would say i was starting high school at the time i would say she was a junior but i had never seen her before she did n't go to my school i did n't know her name and i never will she was sitting with someone who i presume was her mother and they were talking about the novel " dune " they were both big fans mother and daughter [UNK] very unusual they were talking about how their favorite characters were the giant sandworms and then it got stranger that 's when she turned to me and said " are you looking forward to seeing the movie " first of all i was embarrassed because i had not read the novel " dune " at that time i was merely a connoisseur of movies featuring desert planets as i still am but it was also the tone of how she asked the question apropos of nothing like she did n't even care about the answer as though she just wanted to talk to me i did not know what to say i said " yes " i did not even turn my head the movie began i need not remind you that this was david lynch 's version of " dune " in which all of the characters were sexy and deformed at the same time there was a character called the third-stage guild navigator which was a kind of giant floating fetus-creature that lived in a giant tank with this orange mist of psychedelic spice swirling around him allowing him to bend space and time he could never leave the tank or interact with the outside world he had become in his isolation so deformed and so sexy that he had to talk through a kind of old-timey radio to the outside world and could never touch them i mean i liked him a lot better than the sandworms the sandworms were fine but your favorite character please when the movie ended everyone seemed very happy to get up and get out of the theatre as soon as possible except for the girl as i walked out her pace slowed perhaps it was the crutches but it seemed [UNK] [UNK] it seemed as though she might want to talk to me again when i say it out loud it sounds so ridiculous but i can only come to the conclusion that it was what in the alien abductee community they call a " screen memory " a ridiculous false recollection designed by their brain to cover up some trauma [UNK] say of being kidnapped and flown off to a sex pyramid and so i sure am glad i did not slow down to talk to her i sure am glad i never saw her again close encounter three philadelphia pennsylvania 1989 in the mid-to-late '80s the novelist whitley strieber wrote a book called " communion " in which he described his own lifelong experiences being abducted by aliens and he also described the phenomenon known in this community as " lost time " where whitley strieber would suddenly become aware that he could not remember the previous ten minutes or the previous ten hours or the previous ten days and would come to the conclusion that that was when the aliens were taking him and giving him rectal probes this book became naturally an enormous best-seller this image by ted joseph was from that book and was his sort of police sketch of what the creatures looked like that whitley strieber had described to him and it was so successful that they made it into a movie and in 1989 the way i remember it i was in philadelphia visiting my girlfriend and we decided apropos of nothing to go see this movie and the way i remember it the movie featured these details one whitley strieber was played by christopher walken two the alien was played by a rubber puppet three there was a surprisingly long sequence of the film in which the rubber puppet gives christopher walken a rectal probe four this was being shown in a regular movie theater in center city philadelphia five all of which is to say they made a movie out of the book " communion " and it starred christopher walken does something seem strange about this to you something odd something off something wrong with this picture think about it yes the answer is i had a girlfriend what how did this happen when did this happen i remember walking out of the theater and becoming suddenly aware of this fact as we walked hand in hand and pondering these very same questions and to this day i have no answer for you close encounter four the algarve portugal 1991 some years later i and this woman [UNK] we 'll call her " catherine fletcher " [UNK] [UNK] went traveling through the south of portugal together we stayed in old crumbling walled cities in tiny little hotels and we would climb up to the roof and drink vinho verde and watch the sun set and play checkers what did we do this really does anyone do this we went to some topless beaches excuse me no not in my life for what it 's worth we went to sagres which was considered at the time to be the end of the world and there i was chased by a pack of feral dogs on the dock and the lead dog bit me on the ass requiring me to go to a strange portuguese clinic and receive an ass shot make of that what you will our last day in portugal we were in the district capital of faro and catherine decided that she wanted to go to the beach one last time now faro is a bustling little city and to get to the beach she explained you would have to take a bus and then a boat and did i want to come with but i was exhausted and dog-bitten and so i said " no " i remember what she looked like before she left the freckles had grown and multiplied on her face and shoulders clustering into a kind of a tan a tan we were both tan [UNK] is this true her eyes were extra bright and extra blue as a result she was smiling she was a single woman about to go alone into a country not even speaking the language to travel alone by bus and boat to go to a beach she did not know or had never seen i loved her and then she went out into that strange alien land it took me some time to come to my senses i had my own " lost time " moment where i woke up and suddenly realized it was very late in the day almost dinnertime and she had not come back nervous i went down to the street to look for her now i did not speak portuguese i did not know where the beach was i could not call her on a cell phone because this was 1991 and the aliens had not given us that technology yet i realized that the day would only have two possible outcomes either catherine would come back to the hotel or she would never come back to the hotel and so i sat down to wait i did not watch the skies but the very end of the street where the buses and cars and pedestrians and little scooters were moving along and i watched those constellations shift hoping that they would part and i would see her face it was at that moment in that very small town of 30,000 or so that i truly appreciated the vastness of the universe and the searching we might do in it and that 's when the liberians came along five young men [UNK] all laughing happy traveling together coming back to this hotel where they were staying one of them was named joseph and he asked me what was i doing and i explained and he said " do n't worry " he was sure that catherine would be safe but he did not seem so very sure for he sat down to wait with me and for the next two hours they all waited with me taking turns going up to their room coming back telling me jokes distracting me two hours they gave me a message we are not alone and then in the middle of a sentence at the very birth of twilight i turned and looked down the street the stars aligned and she came back she was smiling she did not understand why i was so worried neither did the liberians although there was a huge amount of relief in their laughter as they clapped us on the back and went back up to their room and left us alone in the street holding hands an event like this leaves a scar on the memory much like a piece of alien technology that has been inserted into your buttocks by a " portuguese doctor " and even now a decade and a half later even now that we are married i look for her still whenever she is not in the room and even though i think you 'll agree it is probable that during the time she was away she was kidnapped and replaced by an alien clone i love her and wait for her still thank you for your kind attention .i just want to say my name is emmanuel jal and i come from a long way i 've been telling a story that has been so painful for me it 's been a tough journey for me traveling the world telling my story in form of a book and also telling it like now and also the easiest one was when i was doing it in form of a music so i have branded myself as a war child i 'm doing this because of an old lady in my village now who have lost her children there is no newspaper to cover her pain and what she wants to change in this society and i 'm doing it for a young man who want to create a change and has no way to project his voice because he ca n't write or there is no internet like facebook myspace youtube for them to talk also one thing that kept me pushing this story this painful stories out the dreams i have sometimes is like the voices of the dead that i have seen would tell me " do n't give up keep on going " because sometime i feel like stopping and not doing it because i did n't know what i was putting myself into well i was born in the most difficult time when my country was at war i saw my village burned down the world that meant a lot to me i saw it vanish in my face i saw my aunt in rape when i was only five my mother was claimed by the war my brothers and sisters were scattered and up to now me and my father were detached and i still have issues with him seeing people die every day my mother crying it 's like i was raised in a violence and that made me call myself a war child and not only that when i was eight i became a child soldier i did n't know what was the war for but one thing i knew was an image that i saw that stuck in my head when i went to the training camp i say " i want to kill as many muslims and as many arabs as possible " the training was n't easy but that was the driving force because i wanted to revenge for my family i wanted to revenge for my village luckily now things have changed because i came to discover the truth what was actually killing us was n't the muslims was n't the arabs it was somebody sitting somewhere manipulating the system and using religion to get what they want to get out of us which is the oil the diamond the gold and the land so realizing the truth gave me a position to choose should i continue to hate or let it go so i happened to forgive now i sing music with the muslims i dance with them i even had a movie out called " war child " funded by muslim people so that pain has gone out but my story is huge so i 'm just going to go into a different step now which is easier for me i 'm going to give you poem called " forced to sin " which is from my album " war child " i talk about my story one of the journey that i tread when i was tempted to eat my friend because we had no food and we were like around 400 and only 16 people survived that journey so i hope you 're going to hear this my dreams are like torment my every moment voices in my brain of friends that was slain friends like lual who died by my side of starvation in the burning jungle and the desert plain next was i but jesus heard my cry as i was tempted to eat the rotten flesh of my comrade he gave me comfort we used to raid villages stealing chickens goats and sheeps anything we could eat i knew it was rude but we needed food and therefore i was forced to sin forced to sin to make a living forced to sin to make a living sometimes you got ta lose to win never give up never give in left home at the age of seven one year later live with an ak-47 by my side slept with one eye open wide run duck play dead and hide i 've seen my people die like flies but i 've never seen a dead body at least one that i 've killed but still as i wonder i wo n't go under guns barking like lightning and thunder as a child so young and tender words i ca n't forget i still remember i saw sergeant command raising his hand no retreat no surrender i carry the banner of the trauma war child child without a mama still fighting in the saga yet as i wage this new war i 'm not alone in this drama no sit or stop as i reach for the top i 'm fully dedicated like a patriotic cop i 'm on a fight day and night sometime i do wrong in order to make things right it 's like i 'm living a dream first time i 'm feeling like a human being ah 1 the children of darfur your empty bellies on the telly and now it 's you that i 'm fighting for left home do n't even know the day i 'll ever return my country is war-torn music i used to hear was bombs and fire of guns so many people die that i do n't even cry no more ask god question what am i here for and why are my people poor and why why when the rest of the children were learning how to read and write i was learning how to fight i ate snails vultures rabbits snakes and anything that had life i was ready to eat i know it 's a shame but who is to be blamed thank you what energized me and kept me going is the music i do i never saw anybody to tell my story to them so they could advise me or do therapy so the music had been my therapy for me it 's been where i actually see heaven where i can be happy where i can be a child again in dances through music so one thing i know about music music is the only thing that has power to enter your cell system your mind your heart influence your soul and your spirit and can even influence the way you live without even you knowing music is the only thing that can make you want to wake up your bed and shake your leg without even wanting to do it and so the power music has i normally compare to the power love when love does n't see a color you know if you fall in love with a frog that 's it one testimony about how i find music is powerful is when i was still a soldier back then i hated the people in the north but i do n't know why i do n't hate their music so we party and dance to their music and one thing that shocked me is one day they brought an arab musician to come and entertain the soldiers and i almost broke my leg dancing to his music but i had this question so now i 'm doing music so i know what the power of music is so what 's happening here i 've been in a painful journey today is day number 233 in which i only eat dinner i do n't eat breakfast no lunch and i 've done a campaign called lose to win where i 'm losing so that i could win the battle that i 'm fighting now so my breakfast my lunch i donate it to a charity that i founded because we want to build a school in sudan and i 'm doing this because also it 's a normal thing in my home people eat one meal a day here i am in the west i choose not to so in my village now kids there they normally listen to bbc or any radio and they are waiting to know the day emmanuel will eat his breakfast it means he got the money to build our school and so i made a commitment i say " i 'm gon na not eat my breakfast " i thought i was famous enough that i would raise the money within one month but i 've been humbled so it 's taken me 232 days and i said " no stop until we get it " and like it 's been done on facebook myspace the people are giving three dollars the lowest amount we ever got was 20 cents somebody donated 20 cents online i do n't know how they did it but that moved me and so the importance of education to me is what i 'm willing to die for because i know what it can do to my people education enlighten your brain give you so many chances and you 're able to survive as a nation we have been crippled for so many years we have fed on aid you see a 20-years-old 30-years-old families in a refugee camps they only get the food that drops from the sky from the u.n so these people you 're killing a whole generation if you just give them aid if anybody want to help us this is what we need give us tools give the farmers tools it 's rain africa is fertile they can grow the crops invest in education education so that we have strong institution that can create a revolution to change everything because we have all those old men that are creating wars in africa they will die soon but if you invest in education then we 'll be able to change africa that 's what i 'm asking so in order to do that i founded a charter called gua africa where we put kids in school and now we have a couple in university we have like 40 kids ex-child soldiers mixed with anybody that we feel like we want to support and i said " i 'm going to put it in practice " and with the people that are going to follow me and help me do things that 's what i want to do to change to make a difference in the world well now my time is going so i want to sing a song but i 'll ask you guys to stand up so we celebrate the life of a british aid worker called emma mccune that made it possible for me to be here i 'm gon na sing this song just to inspire you how this woman has made a difference she came to my country and saw the importance of education she said the only way to help sudan is to invest in the women educating them educating the children so that they could come and create a revolution in this complex society so she even ended up marrying a commander from the spla and she rescued over 150 child soldiers one of them happened to be me now and so at this moment i want to ask to celebrate emma with me are you guys ready to celebrate emma audience yes 1 emmanuel jal all right this one goes to emma mccune angel to rescue came one afternoon i 'm here because you rescued me i 'm proud to carry your legacy thank you bless you r.i.p what would i be me 1 if emma never rescued me what would i be what would i be me 1 another starving refugee what would i be what would i be me 1 if emma never rescued me yeah 1 yeah 1 yeah 1 you would have seen my face on the telly fat hungry belly flies in my eyes head too big for my size just another little starving child running around in africa born to be wild praise god praise the almighty for sending an angel to rescue me i got a reason for being on this earth 'cause i know more than many what a life is worth now that i got a chance to stand my ground i 'm gon na run over mountains leaps and bounds i ai n't an angel hope i 'll be one soon and if i am i wan na be like emma mccune me 1 what would i be me 1 if emma never rescued me what would i be what would i be me 1 another starving refugee what would i be what would i be me 1 if emma never rescued me yeah 1 yeah 1 yeah yeah 1 i would have probably died from starvation or some other wretched disease i would have grown up with no education just another refugee i stand here because somebody cared i stand here because somebody dared i know there is a lot of emmas out there who is willing and trying to save a life of a child what would i be me 1 if emma never rescued me what would i be what would i be another starving refugee i remember the time when i was small when i could n't read or write at all now i 'm all grown up i got my education the sky is the limit and i ca n't be stopped by no one how i prayed for this day to come and i pray that the world find wisdom to give the poor in need some assistance instead of putting up resistance yeah sitting and waiting for the politics to fix this it ai n't gon na happen they 're all sitting on they asses popping champagne and sponging off the masses coming from a refugee boy-soldier but i still got my dignity i got ta say it again if emma never rescued me i 'd be a corpse on the african plain is there anybody who 's here in the back some love big scream for emma everybody yeah 1 i 'm gon na get crazy now what would i be if emma never rescued me what would i be another starving refugee what would i be if emma never rescued me yeah yeah yeah i would have probably died from starvation or some other wretched disease i would have grown up with no education just another refugee thank you go save a life of a child .i was born in switzerland and raised in ghana west africa ghana felt safe to me as a child i was free i was happy the early 70s marked a time of musical and artistic excellence in ghana but then by the end of the decade the country had fallen back into political instability and mismanagement in 1979 i witnessed my first military coup we the children had gathered at a friend 's house it was a dimly lit shack there was a beaten up black and white television flickering in the background and a former head of state and general was being blindfolded and tied to the pole the firing squad aimed fired [UNK] the general was dead now this was being broadcast live and shortly after we left the country and we returned to switzerland now europe came as a shock to me and i think i started feeling the need to shed my skin in order to fit in i wanted to blend in like a chameleon i think it was a tactic of survival and it worked or so i believed so here i was in 2008 wondering where i was in my life and i felt i was being typecast as an actor i was always playing the exotic african i was playing the violent african the african terrorist and i was thinking how many terrorists could i possibly play before turning into one myself and i had become ashamed of the other the african in me and fortunately i decided in 2008 to return to ghana after 28 years of absence i wanted to document on film the 2008 presidential elections and there i started by searching for the footprints in my childhood and before i even knew it i was suddenly on a stage surrounded by thousands of cheering people during a political rally and i realized that when i 'd left the country free and fair elections in a democratic environment were a dream and now that i 'd returned that dream had become reality though a fragile reality and i was thinking was ghana searching for its identity like i was looking for my identity was what was happening in ghana a metaphor for what was happening in me and it was as if through the standards of my western life i had n't lived up to my full potential i mean nor had ghana even though we had been trying very hard now in 1957 ghana was the first sub-saharan country to gain its independence in the late 50s ghana and singapore had the same gdp i mean today singapore is a first world country and ghana is not but maybe it was time to prove to myself yes it 's important to understand the past it is important to look at it in a different light but maybe we should look at the strengths in our own culture and build on those foundations in the present so here i was december 7th 2008 the polling stations opened to the voters at 700 am but voters eager to take their own political fate into their hands were starting to line up at 400 am in the morning and they had traveled from near they had traveled from far because they wanted to make their voices heard and i asked one of the voters i said " whom are you going to vote for " and he said " i 'm sorry i ca n't tell you " he said that his vote was in his heart and i understood this was their election and they were n't going to let anyone take it away from them now the first round of the voting did n't bring forth a clear winner [UNK] so nobody had achieved the absolute majority [UNK] so voting went into a second round three weeks later the candidates were back on the road they were campaigning the rhetoric of the candidates of course changed the heat was on and then the cliche came to haunt us there were claims of intimidation at the polling stations of ballot boxes being stolen inflated results started coming in and the mob was starting to get out of control we witnessed the eruption of violence in the streets people were being beaten brutally the army started firing their guns people were scrambling it was complete chaos and my heart sank because i thought here we are again here is another proof that the african is not capable of governing himself and not only that i am documenting it [UNK] documenting my own cultural shortcomings so when the echo of the gunshots had lingered it was soon drowned by the chanting of the mob and i did n't believe what i was hearing they were chanting " we want peace we want peace " and i realized it had to come from the people after all they decide and they did so the sounds that were before distorted and loud were suddenly a melody the sounds of the voices were harmonious so it could happen a democracy could be upheld peacefully it could be by the will of the masses who were now urgently pressing with all their heart and all their will for peace now here 's an interesting comparison we in the west we preach the values the golden light of democracy that we are the shining example of how it 's done but when it comes down to it ghana found itself in the same place in which the u.s. election stalled in the 2000 presidential elections [UNK] bush versus gore but instead of the unwillingness of the candidates to allow the system to proceed and the people to decide ghana honored democracy and its people it did n't leave it up to the supreme court to decide the people did now the second round of voting did not bring forth a clear winner either i mean it was so incredibly close the electoral commissioner declared with the consent of the parties to run an unprecedented second re-run so the people went back to the polls to determine their own president not the legal system and guess what it worked the defeated candidate gave up power and made way for ghana to move into a new democratic cycle i mean at the absolute time for the absolute need of democracy they did not abuse their power the belief in true democracy and in the people runs deep proving that the african is capable of governing himself now the uphill battle for ghana and for africa is not over but i have proof that the other side of democracy exists and that we must not take it for granted now i have learned that my place is not just in the west or in africa and i 'm still searching for my identity but i saw ghana create democracy better ghana taught me to look at people differently and to look at myself differently and yes we africans can thank you .does anybody know when the stethoscope was invented any guesses 1816 and what i can say is in 2016 doctors are n't going to be walking around with stethoscopes there 's a whole lot better technology coming and that 's part of the change in medicine what has changed our society has been wireless devices but the future are digital medical wireless devices ok so let me give you some examples of this to kind of make this much more concrete this is the first one this is an electrocardiogram and as a cardiologist to think that you could see in real time a patient an individual anywhere in the world on your smartphone watching your rhythm [UNK] that 's incredible and it 's with us today but that 's just the beginning you check your email while you 're sitting here in the future you 're going to be checking all your vital signs all your vital signs your heart rhythm your blood pressure your oxygen your temperature etc this is already available today this is airstrip technologies by taking the aggregate of these signals in the hospital in the intensive care unit and putting it on a smartphone for physicians if you 're an expectant parent what about the ability to monitor continuously fetal heart rate or intrauterine contractions and not having to worry so much that things are fine as the pregnancy and moving over into the time of delivery and then as we go further today we have continuous glucose sensors right now they are under the skin but in the future they wo n't have to be implanted and of course the desired range [UNK] trying to keep glucose between 75 and less than 200 checking it every five minutes in a continuous glucose sensor [UNK] you 'll see how that can impact diabetes and what about sleep we 're going to zoom in on that a little bit we 're supposed to spend a third of our life in sleep what if on your phone which will be available in the next few weeks you had every minute of your sleep displayed and this is of course as you can see the awake is the orange the rem sleep rapid eye movement dream state is in light green and light is gray light sleep and deep sleep the best restorative sleep is that dark green how about counting every calorie and this is ability in real time to actually take measurements of caloric intake as well as expenditure through a band-aid now what i 've talked about are physiologic metrics but what i want to get to the next frontier very quickly and why the stethoscope is on its way out is because we can transcend listening to the valve sounds and the breath sounds because now introduced by g.e is a handheld ultra-sound why is this important because this is so much more sensitive here is an example of an abdominal ultrasound and also a cardiac echo which can be sent wireless and then there 's an example of fetal monitoring on your smartphone so we 're not just talking about physiologic metrics [UNK] the key measurements of vital signs and all those things in physiology [UNK] but also all the imaging that one could look at in your smartphone now this is an example of another obsolete technology soon to be buried the holter monitor twenty-four hour recording lots of wires this is now a little tiny patch you can put it on for two weeks and send it in the mail now how does this work well there is these smart band-aids or these sensors that one would put on on a shoe or on the wrist and this sends a signal and it creates a body area network to a gateway gateway could be a smartphone or it could be a dedicated gateway as today many of these things are dedicated gateways because they are not so well integrated that signal goes to the web the cloud and then it can be processed and sent anywhere to a caregiver to a physician back to the patient etc so that 's basically very simplistic technology of how this works now i have this device on i did n't want to take my shirt off to show you but i can tell you it 's on this is a device that not only measures cardiac rhythm as you saw already but it also goes well beyond that this is me now and you can see the ecg below that 's the actual heart rate and the trend to the right of that is a bioconductant that 's the fluid status fluid status that 's really important if you 're monitoring somebody with heart failure and below that 's temperature and respiration and oxygen and then the position activity so this is really striking because this device measures seven things that are very much vital signs for monitoring someone with heart failure ok and why is this important well this is the most expensive bed what if we could reduce the need for hospital beds well we can first of all heart failure is the number one reason for hospital admissions and readmissions in this country the cost of heart failure is 37 billion dollars a year which is 80 percent related to hospitalization and in the course of 30 days after a hospital stay for a medicare greater than 65 years or older is [UNK] 27 percent are readmitted in 30 days and by six months over 56 percent are readmitted so can we improve that well the idea is we take this device that i 'm wearing and we put it on 600 patients with heart failure randomly assigned versus 600 patients who do n't have active monitoring and see whether we can reduce heart failure readmissions and that 's exciting and we 'll start that trial and you 'll hear more about how we 're going to do that but that 's a type of wireless device trial that could change medicine in the years ahead why now why has this all of a sudden become a reality an exciting direction in the future of medicine what we have is in a way a perfect positive storm this sets up consumer-driven healthcare that 's where this is all starting let me just give you specifics about why this is a big movement if you 're not aware of it 1.2 million americans have gotten a nike shoe which is a body-area network that connects the shoe the sole of the shoe to the iphone or an ipod and this wired magazine cover article really captured a lot of this it talked a lot about the nike shoe and how quickly that 's been adopted to monitor exercise physiology and energy expenditure here are some things the principles that are guiding principles to keep in mind " a data-driven health revolution promises to make us all better faster and stronger living by numbers " this was from july this cover article " the personal metrics movement goes way beyond diet and exercise it 's about tracking every facet of life from sleep to mood to pain 247365 " well i tried this device a lot of you have gotten that phillips direct life but i got the fitbit that looks like this it 's like a wireless accelerometer pedometer and i want to just give you the results of that testing because i wanted to understand about the consumer movement i hope the by the way the phillips direct life works better [UNK] i hope so but this monitors food it monitors activity and tracks weight however you have to put in most of this stuff the only thing it really tracks by itself is activity and even then it 's not complete so you exercise and it picks up the exercise you put in your height and weight it calculates bmi and of course it tells you how many calories you 're expending from the exercise and how many you took in if you go in and enter all the foods but it really wants you to enter all your activity and so i went to this and of course i was gratified that it picked up the 42 minutes of exercise elliptical exercise i did but then it wants more information so it says " you want to log sexual activity how long did you do it for " and it says " how hard was it " furthermore it says " start time " now this does n't appear [UNK] this just does n't work i mean this just does n't work so now i want to move to sleep who would ever have thought you could have your own eeg at your home tagged to a very nice alarm clock by the way this is the headband that goes with this alarm clock it monitors your brainwaves continuously when you 're sleeping so i did this thing for seven days getting ready for tedmed this is an important part of our life one-third you 're supposed to be sleeping of course how many here have any problems with sleeping it 's usually 90 percent so you tell me you sleep better than expected okay well this was a week of my life in sleeping and you get a z.q score instead of an i.q score you get a z.q score when you wake up you say " oh ok. " and a z.q score is adjusted to age and you want to get as high as you possibly can so this is the moment-by-moment or minute-by-minute sleep and you see that z.q there was 80-odd and the wake time is in orange and this can be a problem as i learned because it not only helps you with quantifying your sleep but also tells others you 're awake so when my wife came in and she could tell you 're awake " eric i want to talk i want to talk " and i 'm trying to play possum this thing is very very impressive ok so that 's the first night and this one is now 67 and that 's not a good score and this tells you of course how much you had in rem sleep in deep sleep and all this sort of thing this was really fascinating because this gave that quantitation about all the different phases of sleep so it also then tells you how you do compared to your age group it 's like a managed competition of sleep and really interesting stuff look at this thing and say " well i did n't think i was a very good sleeper but actually i did better than average in 50 to 60 year olds " ok and the key thing was what i did n't know was that i was a really good dreamer ok. now let 's move from sleep to diseases eighty percent of americans have chronic disease or 80 percent of age greater than 65 have two or more chronic disease 140 million americans have one or more chronic disease and 80 percent of our 1.5 whatever trillion expenditures are related to chronic disease now diabetes is one of the big ones almost 24 million people have diabetes and here is the latest map it was published just a little more than a week ago in the new york times and it is n't looking good that is for men 29 percent in the country over 60 have type ii diabetes and women although it 's less it 's terribly high but of course we have a way to measure that now on a continuous basis with a sensor that detects blood glucose and it 's important because we could detect hyperglycemia that otherwise would n't be known and also hypoglycemia and you can see the red dots in this particular patient 's case were finger sticks which would have missed both ends but by continuous monitoring it captures all that vital information the future of this though is being able to move this to a band-aid type phenomenon and that 's not so far away so let me just give you very quickly 10 top targets for wireless medicine all these things are possible [UNK] some of them are very close or already as you heard are available today in some way or form alzheimer 's disease there 's five million people affected and you can check vital signs activity balance asthma large number we could detect things like pollen count air quality respiratory rate breast cancer i 'll show you an example of that real quickly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease depression there 's a great approach to that in mood disorders diabetes i 've just mentioned heart failure we already talked about hypertension 74 million people could have continuous blood-pressure monitoring to come up with much better management and prevention and obesity we already talked about the ways to get to that and sleep disorders this is effective around the world the access to smartphones and cell phones today is extraordinary and this article from the economist summed it up beautifully about the opportunities in health across the developing world " mobile phones made a bigger difference to the lives of more people more quickly than any previous technology " and that 's before we got going on the m-health world aging the problem is enormous 300,000 broken hips per year but the solutions are extraordinary and they include so many different things one of the ones i just wanted to mention the ishoe is another example of a sensor that improves proprioception among the elderly to prevent falling one of many different techniques using wireless sensors so we can change medicine across the continuum of care across the ages from premies or unborn children to seniors the pharmaceutical arena changes the full spectrum of disease [UNK] i hope i 've given you a sense of that [UNK] across the globe there are two things that can really accelerate this whole process one of them [UNK] we 're very fortunate [UNK] is to develop a dedicated institute and that 's work that started with the work that scripps with qualcomm 1 and then the great fortune of meeting up with gary and mary west to get behind this wireless health institute san diego is an extraordinary place for this there 's over 650 wireless companies 100 of which or more are working in wireless health it 's the number one source of commerce and interestingly it dovetails beautifully with over 500 life science companies the wireless institute the west wireless health institute is really the outgrowth of two extraordinary people who are here this evening gary and mary west and i 'd like to give it up for them for getting behind this their fantastic philanthropic investment made this possible and this is really a nonprofit education center which is just about to open it looks like this this whole building dedicated and what it 's trying to do is accelerate this era to take unmet medical needs to work and innovate [UNK] and we just appointed the chief engineer mehran mehregany it was announced on monday [UNK] then to move up with development clinical trial validation and then changing medical practice the most challenging thing of all requiring attention to reimbursement healthcare policy healthcare economics the other big thing besides having this fantastic institute to catalyze this process is guidance and that 's of course relying on the fact that medicine goes digital if we understand biology from genomics and omics and wireless through physiologic phenotyping that 's big because what it does is allow a convergence like we 've never had before over 80 major diseases have been cracked at the genomic level but this is quite extraordinary more has been learned about the underpinnings of disease in the last two and a half years than in the history of man and when you put that together with for example now an app for the iphone with your genotype to guide drug therapy 1 but the future [UNK] we can now tell who 's going to get type ii diabetes from all the common variants and that 's going to get filled in more with low-frequency variants in the future we can tell who 's going to get breast cancer from the various genes we can also know who 's likely to get atrial fibrillation and finally another example sudden cardiac death each of these has a sensor we can give glucose a sensor for diabetes to prevent it we can prevent or have the earliest detection possible for breast cancer with an ultrasound device given to the patient an ipatch irhythm for atrial fibrillation and vital-signs monitoring to prevent sudden cardiac death we lose 700,000 people a year in the u.s. from sudden cardiac death so i hope i 've convinced you of this of the impact on hospital clinic resources is profound and then the impact on diseases is equally impressive across all these different diseases and more it 's really taking individualized medicine to a new height and it 's hyper-innovative and i think it represents the black swan of medicine thanks for your attention .so i 'm here to tell you a story of success from africa a year and a half ago four of the five people who are full time members at ushahidi which means " testimony " in swahili were ted fellows a year ago in kenya we had post-election violence and in that time we prototyped and built in about three days a system that would allow anybody with a mobile phone to send in information and reports on what was happening around them we took what we knew about africa the default device the mobile phone as our common denominator and went from there we got reports like this this is just a couple of them from january 17th last year and our system was rudimentary it was very basic it was a mash-up that used data that we collected from people and we put it on our map but then we decided we needed to do something more we needed to take what we had built and create a platform out of it so that it could be used elsewhere in the world and so there is a team of developers from all over africa who are part of this team now [UNK] from ghana from malawi from kenya there is even some from the u.s. we 're building for smartphones so that it can be used in the developed world as well as the developing world we are realizing that this is true if it works in africa then it will work anywhere and so we build for it in africa first and then we move to the edges it 's now been deployed in the democratic republic of the congo it 's being used by ngos all over east africa small ngos doing their own little projects just this last month it was deployed by al jazeera in gaza but that 's actually not what i 'm here to talk about i 'm here to talk about the next big thing because what we 're finding out is that we have this capacity to report eyewitness accounts of what 's going on in real time we 're seeing this in events like mumbai recently where it 's so much easier to report now than it is to consume it there is so much information what do you do this is the twitter reports for over three days just covering mumbai how do you decide what is important what is the veracity level of what you 're looking at so what we find is that there is this great deal of wasted crisis information because there is just too much information for us to actually do anything with right now and what we 're actually really concerned with is this first three hours what we are looking at is the first three hours how do we deal with that information that is coming in you ca n't understand what is actually happening on the ground and around the world people are still curious and trying to figure out what is going on but they do n't know so what we built of course ushahidi is crowdsourcing this information you see this with twitter too you get this information overload so you 've got a lot of information that 's great but now what so we think that there is something interesting we can do here and we have a small team who is working on this we think that we can actually create a crowdsourced filter take the crowd and apply them to the information and by rating it and by rating the different people who submit information we can get refined results and weighted results so that we have a better understanding of the probability of something being true or not this is the kind of innovation that is quite frankly [UNK] it 's interesting that it 's coming from africa it 's coming from places that you would n't expect from young smart developers and it 's a community around it that has decided to build this so thank you very much and we are very happy to be part of the ted family .thank you ooh i 'm like " phew phew calm down get back into my body now " usually when i play out the first thing that happens is people scream out " what 's she doing 1 " i 'll play at these rock shows be on stage standing completely still and they 're like " what 's she doing 1 what 's she doing 1 " and then i 'll kind of be like [UNK] [UNK] and then they 're like " whoa 1 " i 'm sure you 're trying to figure out " well how does this thing work " well what i 'm doing is controlling the pitch with my left hand see the closer i get to this antenna the higher the note gets [UNK] [UNK] and you can get it really low and with this hand i 'm controlling the volume so the further away my right hand gets the louder it gets so basically with both of your hands you 're controlling pitch and volume and kind of trying to create the illusion that you 're doing separate notes when really it 's continuously going 1 sometimes i startle myself i 'll forget that i have it on and i 'll lean over to pick up something and then it goes like [UNK] [UNK] " oh 1 " and it 's like a funny sound effect that follows you around if you do n't turn the thing off maybe we 'll go into the next tune because i totally lost where this is going we 're going to do a song by david mash called " listen the words are gone " and maybe i 'll have words come back into me afterwards if i can relax so i 'm trying to think of some of the questions that are commonly asked there are so many and 1 well i guess i could tell you a little of the history of the theremin it was invented around the 1920s and the inventor léon theremin [UNK] he also was a musician besides an inventor [UNK] he came up with the idea for making the theremin i think when he was working on some shortwave radios and there 'd be that sound in the signal [UNK] it 's like [UNK] and he thought " oh what if i could control that sound and turn it into an instrument because there are pitches in it " and so somehow through developing that he eventually came to make the theremin the way it is now and a lot of times even kids nowadays they 'll make reference to a theremin by going " whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo " because in the '50s it was used in the sci-fi horror movies that sound that 's like 1 it 's kind of a funny goofy sound to do and sometimes if i have too much coffee then my vibrato gets out of hand you 're really sensitive to your body and its functions when you 're behind this thing you have to stay so still if you want to have the most control it reminds me of the balancing act earlier on [UNK] what michael was doing [UNK] because you 're fighting so hard to keep the balance with what you 're playing with and stay in tune and at the same time you do n't want to focus so much on being in tune all the time you want to be feeling the music and then also you 're trying to stay very very very still because little movements with other parts of your body will affect the pitch or sometimes if you 're holding a low note [UNK] [UNK] and breathing will make it 1 if i pass out on the next song 1 i think of it almost like like a yoga instrument because it makes you so aware of every little crazy thing your body is doing or just aware of what you do n't want it to be doing while you 're playing you do n't want to have any sudden movements and if i go to a club and play a gig people are like " here have some drinks on us 1 " and it 's like " well i 'm about to go on soon i do n't want to be like [UNK] [UNK] you know " it really does reflect the mood that you 're in also if you 're 1 it 's similar to being a vocalist except instead of it coming out of your throat you 're controlling it just in the air and you do n't really have a point of reference you 're always relying on your ears and adjusting constantly you just have to always adjust to what 's happening and realize you 'll have bummer notes come here and there and listen to it adjust it and just move on or else you 'll get too tied up and go crazy like me i think we will play another tune now i 'm going to do " lush life " it 's one of my favorite tunes to play .hi my name is roz savage and i row across oceans four years ago i rowed solo across the atlantic and since then i 've done two out of three stages across the pacific from san francisco to hawaii and from hawaii to kiribati and tomorrow i 'll be leaving this boat to fly back to kiribati to continue with the third and final stage of my row across the pacific cumulatively i will have rowed over 8,000 miles taken over three million oar strokes and spent more than 312 days alone on the ocean on a 23 foot rowboat this has given me a very special relationship with the ocean we have a bit of a lovehate thing going on i feel a bit about it like i did about a very strict math teacher that i once had at school i did n't always like her but i did respect her and she taught me a heck of a lot so today i 'd like to share with you some of my ocean adventures and tell you a little bit about what they 've taught me and how i think we can maybe take some of those lessons and apply them to this environmental challenge that we face right now now some of you might be thinking " hold on a minute she does n't look very much like an ocean rower is n't she meant to be about this tall and about this wide and maybe look a bit more like these guys " you 'll notice they 've all got something that i do n't well i do n't know what you 're thinking but i 'm talking about the beards and no matter how long i 've spent on the ocean i have n't yet managed to muster a decent beard and i hope that it remains that way for a long time i did n't believe that i could have a big adventure the story that i told myself was that adventurers looked like this i did n't look the part i thought there were them and there were us and i was not one of them so for 11 years i conformed i did what people from my kind of background were supposed to do i was working in an office in london as a management consultant and i think i knew from day one that it was n't the right job for me but that kind of conditioning just kept me there for so many years until i reached my mid-30s and i thought " you know i 'm not getting any younger i feel like i 've got a purpose in this life and i do n't know what it is but i 'm pretty certain that management consultancy is not it so fast forward a few years i 'd gone through some changes to try and answer that question of " what am i supposed to be doing with my life " i sat down one day and wrote two versions of my own obituary the one that i wanted a life of adventure and the one that i was actually heading for which was a nice normal pleasant life but it was n't where i wanted to be by the end of my life i wanted to live a life that i could be proud of and i remember looking at these two versions of my obituary and thinking " oh boy i 'm on totally the wrong track here if i carry on living as i am now i 'm just not going to end up where i want to be in five years or 10 years or at the end of my life " i made a few changes let go of some loose trappings of my old life and through a bit of a leap of logic decided to row across the atlantic ocean the atlantic rowing race runs from the canaries to antigua it 's about 3,000 miles and it turned out to be the hardest thing i had ever done sure i had wanted to get outside of my comfort zone but what i 'd sort of failed to notice was that getting out of your comfort zone is by definition extremely uncomfortable and my timing was not great either 2005 when i did the atlantic was the year of hurricane katrina there were more tropical storms in the north atlantic than ever before since records began and pretty early on those storms started making their presence known all four of my oars broke before i reached halfway across oars are not supposed to look like this but what can you do you 're in the middle of the ocean oars are your only means of propulsion so i just had to look around the boat and figure out what i was going to use to fix up these oars so that i could carry on so i found a boat hook and my trusty duct tape and splintered the boat hook to the oars to reinforce it then when that gave out i sawed the wheel axles off my spare rowing seat and used those and then when those gave out i cannibalized one of the broken oars i 'd never been very good at fixing stuff when i was living my old life but it 's amazing how resourceful you can become when you 're in the middle of the ocean and there 's only one way to get to the other side and the oars kind of became a symbol of just in how many ways i went beyond what i thought were my limits i suffered from tendinitis on my shoulders and saltwater sores on my bottom i really struggled psychologically totally overwhelmed by the scale of the challenge realizing that if i carried on moving at two miles an hour 3,000 miles was going to take me a very very long time there were so many times when i thought i 'd hit that limit but had no choice but to just carry on and try and figure out how i was going to get to the other side without driving myself crazy and eventually after 103 days at sea i arrived in antigua i do n't think i 've ever felt so happy in my entire life it was a bit like finishing a marathon and getting out of solitary confinement and winning an oscar all rolled into one i was euphoric and to see all the people coming out to greet me and standing along the cliff tops and clapping and cheering i just felt like a movie star it was absolutely wonderful and i really learned then that the bigger the challenge the bigger the sense of achievement when you get to the end of it so this might be a good moment to take a quick time-out to answer a few faqs about ocean rowing that might be going through your mind number one that i get asked what do you eat a few freeze-dried meals but mostly i try and eat much more unprocessed foods so i grow my own beansprouts i eat fruits and nut bars a lot of nuts and generally arrive about 30 pounds lighter at the other end question number two how do you sleep with my eyes shut ha-ha i suppose what you mean is what happens to the boat while i 'm sleeping well i plan my route so that i 'm drifting with the winds and the currents while i 'm sleeping on a good night i think my best ever was 11 miles in the right direction worst ever 13 miles in the wrong direction that 's a bad day at the office what do i wear mostly a baseball cap rowing gloves and a smile [UNK] or a frown depending on whether i went backwards overnight [UNK] and lots of sun lotion do i have a chase boat no i do n't i 'm totally self-supporting out there i do n't see anybody for the whole time that i 'm at sea generally and finally am i crazy well i leave that one up to you to judge so how do you top rowing across the atlantic well naturally you decide to row across the pacific well i thought the atlantic was big but the pacific is really really big i think we tend to do it a little bit of a disservice in our usual maps i do n't know for sure that the brits invented this particular view of the world but i suspect we might have done so we are right in the middle and we 've cut the pacific in half and flung it to the far corners of the world whereas if you look in google earth this is how the pacific looks it pretty much covers half the planet you can just see a little bit of north america up here and a sliver of australia down there it is really big [UNK] 65 million square miles [UNK] and to row in a straight line across it would be about 8,000 miles unfortunately ocean rowboats very rarely go in a straight line by the time i get to australia if i get to australia i will have rowed probably nine or 10,000 miles in all so because nobody in their straight mind would row straight past hawaii without dropping in i decided to cut this very big undertaking into three segments the first attempt did n't go so well in 2007 i did a rather involuntary capsize drill three times in 24 hours a bit like being in a washing machine boat got a bit dinged up so did i i blogged about it unfortunately somebody with a bit of a hero complex decided that this damsel was in distress and needed saving the first i knew about this was when the coast guard plane turned up overhead i tried to tell them to go away we had a bit of a battle of wills i lost and got airlifted awful really awful it was one of the worst feelings of my life as i was lifted up on that winch line into the helicopter and looked down at my trusty little boat rolling around in the 20 foot waves and wondering if i would ever see her again so i had to launch a very expensive salvage operation and then wait another nine months before i could get back out onto the ocean again but what do you do fall down nine times get up 10 so the following year i set out and fortunately this time made it safely across to hawaii but it was not without misadventure my watermaker broke only the most important piece of kit that i have on the boat powered by my solar panels it sucks in saltwater and turns it into freshwater but it does n't react very well to being immersed in ocean which is what happened to it fortunately help was at hand there was another unusual boat out there at the same time doing as i was doing bringing awareness to the north pacific garbage patch that area in the north pacific about twice the size of texas with an estimated 3.5 million tons of trash in it circulating at the center of that north pacific gyre so to make the point these guys had actually built their boat out of plastic trash 15,000 empty water bottles latched together into two pontoons they were going very slowly partly they 'd had a bit of a delay they 'd had to pull in at catalina island shortly after they left long beach because the lids of all the water bottles were coming undone and they were starting to sink so they 'd had to pull in and do all the lids up but as i was approaching the end of my water reserves luckily our courses were converging they were running out of food i was running out of water so we liaised by satellite phone and arranged to meet up and it took about a week for us to actually gradually converge i was doing a pathetically slow speed of about 1.3 knots and they were doing only marginally less pathetic speed of about 1.4 it was like two snails in a mating dance but eventually we did manage to meet up and joel hopped overboard caught us a beautiful big mahi-mahi which was the best food i 'd had in ooh at least three months fortunately the one that he caught that day was better than this one they caught a few weeks earlier when they opened this one up they found its stomach was full of plastic and this is really bad news because plastic is not an inert substance it leaches out chemicals into the flesh of the poor critter that ate it and then we come along and eat that poor critter and we get some of the toxins accumulating in our bodies as well so there are very real implications for human health i eventually made it to hawaii still alive and the following year set out on the second stage of the pacific from hawaii down to tarawa and you 'll notice something about tarawa it is very low-lying it 's that little green sliver on the horizon which makes them very nervous about rising oceans this is big trouble for these guys they 've got no points of land more than about six feet above sea level and also as an increase in extreme weather events due to climate change they 're expecting more waves to come in over the fringing reef which will contaminate their fresh water supply i had a meeting with the president there who told me about his exit strategy for his country he expects that within the next 50 years the 100,000 people that live there will have to relocate to new zealand or australia and that made me think about how would i feel if britain was going to disappear under the waves if the places where i 'd been born and gone to school and got married if all those places were just going to disappear forever how literally ungrounded that would make me feel very shortly i 'll be setting out to try and get to australia and if i 'm successful i 'll be the first woman ever to row solo all the way across the pacific and i try to use this to bring awareness to these environmental issues to bring a human face to the ocean if the atlantic was about my inner journey discovering my own capabilities maybe the pacific has been about my outer journey figuring out how i can use my interesting career choice to be of service to the world and to take some of those things that i 've learned out there and apply them to the situation that humankind now finds itself in i think there are probably three key points here the first one is about the stories that we tell ourselves for so long i told myself that i could n't have an adventure because i was n't six foot tall and athletic and bearded and then that story changed i found out that people had rowed across oceans i even met one of them and she was just about my size so even though i did n't grow any taller i did n't sprout a beard something had changed my interior dialogue had changed at the moment the story that we collectively tell ourselves is that we need all this stuff that we need oil but what about if we just change that story we do have alternatives and we have the power of free will to choose those alternatives those sustainable ones to create a greener future the second point is about the accumulation of tiny actions we might think that anything that we do as an individual is just a drop in the ocean that it ca n't really make a difference but it does generally we have n't got ourselves into this mess through big disasters yes there have been the exxon valdezes and the chernobyls but mostly it 's been an accumulation of bad decisions by billions of individuals day after day and year after year and by the same token we can turn that tide we can start making better wiser more sustainable decisions and when we do that we 're not just one person anything that we do spreads ripples other people will see if you 're in the supermarket line and you pull out your reusable grocery bag maybe if we all start doing this we can make it socially unacceptable to say yes to plastic in the checkout line that 's just one example this is a world-wide community the other point it 's about taking responsibility for so much of my life i wanted something else to make me happy i thought if i had the right house or the right car or the right man in my life then i could be happy but when i wrote that obituary exercise i actually grew up a little bit in that moment and realized that i needed to create my own future i could n't just wait passively for happiness to come and find me and i suppose i 'm a selfish environmentalist i plan on being around for a long time and when i 'm 90 years old i want to be happy and healthy and it 's very difficult to be happy on a planet that 's racked with famine and drought it 's very difficult to be healthy on a planet where we 've poisoned the earth and the sea and the air so shortly i 'm going to be launching a new initiative called eco-heroes and the idea here is that all our eco-heroes will log at least one green deed every day it 's meant to be a bit of a game we 're going to make an iphone app out of it we just want to try and create that awareness because sure changing a light bulb is n't going to change the world but that attitude that awareness that leads you to change the light bulb or take your reusable coffee mug that is what could change the world i really believe that we stand at a very important point in history we have a choice we 've been blessed or cursed with free will we can choose a greener future and we can get there if we all pull together to take it one stroke at a time thank you .my journey to become a polar specialist photographing specializing in the polar regions began when i was four years old when my family moved from southern canada to northern baffin island up by greenland there we lived with the inuit in the tiny inuit community of 200 inuit people where [ we ] were one of three non-inuit families and in this community we did n't have a television we did n't have computers obviously radio we did n't even have a telephone all of my time was spent outside with the inuit playing the snow and the ice were my sandbox and the inuit were my teachers and that 's where i became truly obsessed with this polar realm and i knew someday that i was going to do something that had to do with trying to share news about it and protect it i 'd like to share with you for just two minutes only some images a cross-section of my work to the beautiful music by brandi carlile " have you ever " i do n't know why national geographic has done this they 've never done this before but they 're allowing me to show you a few images from a coverage that i 've just completed that is not published yet national geographic does n't do this so i 'm very excited to be able to share this with you and what these images are [UNK] you 'll see them at the start of the slide show [UNK] there 's only about four images [UNK] but it 's of a little bear that lives in the great bear rainforest it 's pure white but it 's not a polar bear it 's a spirit bear or a kermode bear there are only 200 of these bears left they 're more rare than the panda bear i sat there on the river for two months without seeing one i thought my career 's over i proposed this stupid story to national geographic what in the heck was i thinking so i had two months to sit there and figure out different ways of what i was going to do in my next life after i was a photographer because they were going to fire me because national geographic is a magazine they remind us all the time they publish pictures not excuses and after two months of sitting there [UNK] one day thinking that it was all over this incredible big white male came down right beside me three feet away from me and he went down and grabbed a fish and went off in the forest and ate it and then i spent the entire day living my childhood dream of walking around with this bear through the forest he went through this old-growth forest and sat up beside this 400-year-old culturally modified tree and went to sleep and i actually got to sleep within three feet of him just in the forest and photograph him so i 'm very excited to be able to show you those images and a cross-section of my work that i 've done on the polar regions please enjoy brandi carlile have you ever wandered lonely through the woods and everything there feels just as it should you 're part of the life there you 're part of something good if you 've ever wandered lonely through the woods ooh ooh ooh ooh if you 've ever wandered lonely through the woods have you ever stared into a starry sky lying on your back you 're asking why what 's the purpose i wonder who am i if you 've ever stared into a starry sky ooh ooh ooh ooh aah ah aah ah oh oh ah ah oh oh have you ever stared into a starry sky have you ever been out walking in the snow tried to get back where you were before you always end up not knowing where to go if you 've ever been out walking in the snow ooh ooh ooh ooh aah ah aah ah aah ah ah oh ah ah oh ah oh ah ah ah ah ah oh ah ah oh oh if you 'd ever been out walking you would know paul nicklen thank you very much the show 's not over my clock is ticking okay let 's stop thank you very much i appreciate it we 're inundated with news all the time that the sea ice is disappearing and it 's at its lowest level and in fact scientists were originally saying sea ice is going to disappear in the next hundred years then they said 50 years now they 're saying the sea ice in the arctic the summertime extent is going to be gone in the next four to 10 years and what does that mean after a while of reading this in the news it just becomes news you glaze over with it and what i 'm trying to do with my work is put faces to this and i want people to understand and get the concept that if we lose ice we stand to lose an entire ecosystem projections are that we could lose polar bears they could become extinct in the next 50 to 100 years and there 's no better sexier more beautiful charismatic megafauna species for me to hang my campaign on polar bears are amazing hunters this was a bear i sat with for a while on the shores there was no ice around but this glacier caved into the water and a seal got on it and this bear swam out to that seal [UNK] 800 lb bearded seal [UNK] grabbed it swam back and ate it and he was so full he was so happy and so fat eating this seal that as i approached him [UNK] about 20 feet away [UNK] to get this picture his only defense was to keep eating more seal and as he ate he was so full [UNK] he probably had about 200 lbs of meat in his belly [UNK] and as he ate inside one side of his mouth he was regurgitating out the other side of his mouth so as long as these bears have any bit of ice they will survive but it 's the ice that 's disappearing we 're finding more and more dead bears in the arctic when i worked on polar bears as a biologist 20 years ago we never found dead bears and in the last four or five years we 're finding dead bears popping up all over the place we 're seeing them in the beaufort sea floating in the open ocean where the ice has melted out i found a couple in norway last year we 're seeing them on the ice these bears are already showing signs of the stress of disappearing ice here 's a mother and her two year-old cub were traveling on a ship a hundred miles offshore in the middle of nowhere and they 're riding on this big piece of glacier ice which is great for them they 're safe at this point they 're not going to die of hypothermia they 're going to get to land but unfortunately 95 percent of the glaciers in the arctic are also receding right now to the point that the ice is ending up on land and not injecting any ice back into the ecosystem these ringed seals these are the " fatsicles " of the arctic these little fat dumplings 150-pound bundles of blubber are the mainstay of the polar bear and they 're not like the harbor seals that you have here these ringed seals also live out their entire life cycle associated and connected to sea ice they give birth inside the ice and they feed on the arctic cod that live under the ice and here 's a picture of sick ice this is a piece of multi-year ice that 's 12 years old and what scientists did n't predict is that as this ice melts these big pockets of black water are forming and they 're grabbing the sun 's energy and accelerating the melting process and here we are diving in the beaufort sea the visibility 's 600 ft. we 're on our safety lines the ice is moving all over the place i wish i could spend half an hour telling you about how we almost died on this dive but what 's important in this picture is that you have a piece of multi-year ice that big chunk of ice up in the corner in that one single piece of ice you have 300 species of microorganisms and in the spring when the sun returns to the ice it forms the phytoplankton grows under that ice and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed and then you get the zoo plankton feeding on all that life so really what the ice does is it acts like a garden it acts like the soil in a garden it 's an inverted garden losing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden here 's me in my office i hope you appreciate yours this is after an hour under the ice i ca n't feel my lips my face is frozen i ca n't feel my hands i ca n't feel my feet and i 've come up and all i wanted to do was get out of the water after an hour in these conditions it 's so extreme that when i go down almost every dive i vomit into my regulator because my body ca n't deal with the stress of the cold on my head and so i 'm just so happy that the dive is over i get to hand my camera to my assistant and i 'm looking up at him and i 'm going " woo woo woo " which means " take my camera " and he thinks i 'm saying " take my picture " so we had this little communication breakdown but it 's worth it i 'm going to show you pictures of beluga whales bowhead whales and narwhals and polar bears and leopard seals today but this picture right here means more to me than any other i 've ever made i dropped down in this ice hole just through that hole that you just saw and i looked up under the underside of the ice and i was dizzy i thought i had vertigo i got very nervous [UNK] no rope no safety line the whole world is moving around me [UNK] and i thought " i 'm in trouble " but what happened is that the entire underside was full of these billions of amphipods and copepods moving around and feeding on the underside of the ice giving birth and living out their entire life cycle this is the foundation of the whole food chain in the arctic right here and when you have low productivity in this in ice the productivity in copepods go down this is a bowhead whale supposedly science is stating that it could be the oldest living animal on earth right now this very whale right here could be over 250 years old this whale could have been born around the start of the industrial revolution it could have survived 150 years of whaling and now its biggest threat is the disappearance of ice in the north because of the lives that we 're leading in the south narwhals these majestic narwhals with their eight-foot long ivory tusks do n't have to be here they could be out on the open water but they 're forcing themselves to come up in these tiny little ice holes where they can breathe catch a breath because right under that ice are all the swarms of cod and the cod are there because they are feeding on all the copepods and amphipods alright my favorite part when i 'm on my deathbed i 'm going to remember one story more than any other even though that spirit bear moment was powerful i do n't think i 'll ever have another experience like i did with these leopard seals leopard seals since the time of shackleton have had a bad reputation they 've got that wryly smile on their mouth they 've got those black sinister eyes and those spots on their body they look positively prehistoric and a bit scary and tragically in [ 2003 ] a scientist was taken down and drowned and she was being consumed by a leopard seal and people were like " we knew they were vicious we knew they were " and so people love to form their opinions and that 's when i got a story idea i want to go to antarctica get in the water with as many leopard seals as i possibly can and give them a fair shake [UNK] find out if they really are these vicious animals or if they 're misunderstood so this is that story oh and they also happen to eat happy feet as a species as humans we like to say penguins are really cute therefore leopard seals eat them so leopard seals are ugly and bad it does n't work that way the penguin does n't know it 's cute and the leopard seal does n't know it 's kind of big and monstrous this is just the food chain unfolding they 're also big they 're not these little harbor seals they are 12 ft. long a thousand pounds and they 're also curiously aggressive you get 12 tourists packed into a zodiac floating in these icy waters and a leopard seal comes up and bites the pontoon the boat starts to sink they race back to the ship and get to go home and tell the stories of how they got attacked all the leopard seal was doing [UNK] it 's just biting a balloon it just sees this big balloon in the ocean [UNK] it does n't have hands [UNK] it 's going to take a little bite the boat pops and off they go so after five days of crossing the drake passage [UNK] is n't that beautiful after five days of crossing the drake passage we have finally arrived at antarctica i 'm with my swedish assistant and guide his name is goran ehlme from sweden [UNK] goran and he has a lot of experience with leopard seals i have never seen one so we come around the cove in our little zodiac boat and there 's this monstrous leopard seal and even in his voice he goes " that 's a bloody big seal ya " and this seal is taking this penguin by the head and it 's flipping it back and forth and what it 's trying to do is turn that penguin inside-out so it can eat the meat off the bones and then it goes off and gets another one and so this leopard seal grabbed another penguin came under the boat the zodiac starting hitting the hull of the boat and we 're trying to not fall in the water and we sit down and that 's when goran said to me " this is a good seal ya it 's time for you to get in the water " and i looked at goran and i said to him " forget that " but i think i probably used a different word starting with the letter f but he was right he scolded me out and said " this is why we 're here and you purposed this stupid story to national geographic and now you 've got to deliver and you ca n't publish excuses " so i had such dry mouth [UNK] probably not as bad as now [UNK] but i had such such dry mouth and my legs were just trembling i could n't feel my legs i put my flippers on i could barely part my lips i put my snorkel in my mouth and i rolled over the side of the zodiac into the water and this was the first thing she did she came racing up to me engulfed my whole camera [UNK] and her teeth are up here and down here [UNK] but goran before i had gotten in the water had given me amazing advice he said " if you get scared you close your eyes ya and she 'll go away " so that 's all i had to work with at that point but i just started to shoot these pictures so she did this threat display for a few minutes and then the most amazing thing happened [UNK] she totally relaxed she went off she got a penguin she stopped about 10 feet away from me and she sat there with this penguin the penguin 's flapping and she let 's it go the penguin swims toward me takes off she grabs another one she does this over and over and it dawned on me that she 's trying to feed me a penguin why else would she release these penguins at me and after she did this four or five times she swam by me with this dejected look on her face you do n't want to be too anthropomorphic but i swear that she looked at me like " this useless predator 's going to starve in my ocean " so realizing i could n't catch swimming penguins she 'd get these other penguins and bring them slowly towards me bobbing like this and she 'd let them go this did n't work i was laughing so hard and so emotional that my mask was flooding because i was crying underwater just because it was so amazing and so that did n't work so then she 'd get another penguin and try this ballet-like sexy display sliding down this iceberg like this and she would sort of bring them over to me and offer it to me this went on for four days this just did n't happen a couple of times and then so she realized i could n't catch live ones so she brought me dead penguins now i 've got four or five penguins floating around my head and i 'm just sitting there shooting away and she would often stop and have this dejected look on her face like " are you for real " because she ca n't believe i ca n't eat this penguin because in her world you 're either breeding or you 're eating [UNK] and i 'm not breeding so 1 and then that was n't enough she started to flip penguins onto my head she was trying to force-feed me she 's pushing me around she 's trying to force-feed my camera which is every photographer 's dream and she would get frustrated she 'd blow bubbles in my face she would i think let me know that i was going to starve but yet she did n't stop she would not stop trying to feed me penguins and on the last day with this female where i thought i had pushed her too far i got nervous because she came up to me she rolled over on her back and she did this deep guttural jackhammer sound this gokgokgokgok and i thought she 's about to bite she 's about to let me know she 's too frustrated with me what had happened was another seal had snuck in behind me and she did that to threat display she chased that big seal away went and got its penguin and brought it to me that was n't the only seal i got in the water with i got in the water with 30 other leopard seals and i never once had a scary encounter they are the most remarkable animals i 've ever worked with and the same with polar bears and just like the polar bears these animals depend on an icy environment i get emotional sorry it 's a story that lives deep in my heart and i 'm proud to share this with you and i 'm so passionate about it anybody want to come with me to antarctica or the arctic i 'll take you let 's go we 've got to get the story out now thank you very much thank you thank you thank you thanks very much thank you .as technology progresses and as it advances many of us assume that these advances make us more intelligent make us smarter and more connected to the world and what i 'd like to argue is that that 's not necessarily the case as progress is simply a word for change and with change you gain something but you also lose something and to really illustrate this point what i 'd like to do is to show you how technology has dealt with a very simple a very common an everyday question and that question is this what time is it what time is it if you glance at your iphone it 's so simple to tell the time but i 'd like to ask you how would you tell the time if you did n't have an iphone how would you tell the time say 600 years ago how would you do it well the way you would do it is by using a device that 's called an astrolabe so an astrolabe is relatively unknown in today 's world but at the time in the 13th century it was the gadget of the day it was the world 's first popular computer and it was a device that in fact is a model of the sky so the different parts of the astrolabe in this particular type the rete corresponds to the positions of the stars the plate corresponds to a coordinate system and the mater has some scales and puts it all together if you were an educated child you would know how to not only use the astrolabe you would also know how to make an astrolabe and we know this because the first treatise on the astrolabe the first technical manual in the english language was written by geoffrey chaucer to his little lewis his 11-year-old son and in this book little lewis would know the big idea and the central idea that makes this computer work is this thing called stereographic projection and basically the concept is how do you represent the three-dimensional image of the night sky that surrounds us onto a flat portable two-dimensional surface the idea is actually relatively simple imagine that that earth is at the center of the universe and surrounding it is the sky projected onto a sphere each point on the surface of the sphere is mapped through the bottom pole onto a flat surface where it is then recorded so the north star corresponds to the center of the device the ecliptic which is the path of the sun moon and planets correspond to an offset circle the bright stars correspond to little daggers on the rete and the altitude corresponds to the plate system now the real genius of the astrolabe is not just the projection the real genius is that it brings together two coordinate systems so they fit perfectly there is the position of the sun moon and planets on the movable rete and then there is their location on the sky as seen from a certain latitude on the back plate okay so how would you use this device well let me first back up for a moment this is an astrolabe pretty impressive is n't it and so this astrolabe is on loan from us from the oxford school of [UNK] museum of history and you can see the different components this is the mater the scales on the back this is the rete okay do you see that that 's the movable part of the sky and in the back you can see a spider web pattern and that spider web pattern corresponds to the local coordinates in the sky this is a rule device and on the back are some other devices measuring tools and scales to be able to make some calculations okay you know i 've always wanted one of these for my thesis i actually built one of these out of paper and this one this is a replica from a 15th-century device and it 's worth probably about three macbook pros but a real one would cost about as much as my house and the house next to it and actually every house on the block on both sides of the street maybe a school thrown in and some [UNK] you know a church they are just incredibly expensive but let me show you how to work this device so let 's go to step one first thing that you do is you select a star in the night sky if you 're telling time at night so tonight if it 's clear you 'll be able to see the summer triangle and there is a bright star called deneb so let 's select deneb second is you measure the altitude of deneb so step two i hold the device up and then i sight its altitude there so i can see it clearly now and then i measure its altitude so it 's about 26 degrees you ca n't see it from over there step three is identify the star on the front of the device deneb is there i can tell step four is i then move the rete move the sky so the altitude of the star corresponds to the scale on the back okay so when that happens everything lines up i have here a model of the sky that corresponds to the real sky okay so it is in a sense holding a model of the universe in my hands and then finally i take a rule and move the rule to a date line which then tells me the time here right so that 's how the device is used so i know what you 're thinking " that 's a lot of work is n't it is n't it a ton of work to be able to tell the time " as you glance at your ipod to just check out the time but there is a difference between the two because with your ipod you can tell [UNK] or your iphone you can tell exactly what the time is with precision the way little lewis would tell the time is by a picture of the sky he would know where things would fit in the sky he would not only know what time it was he would also know where the sun would rise and how it would move across the sky he would know what time the sun would rise and what time it would set and he would know that for essentially every celestial object in the heavens so in computer graphics and computer user interface design there is a term called affordances so affordances are the qualities of an object that allow us to perform an action with it and what the astrolabe does is it allows us it affords us to connect to the night sky to look up into the night sky and be much more [UNK] to see the visible and the invisible together so that 's just one use incredible there is probably 350 400 uses in fact there is a text and that has over a thousand uses of this first computer on the back there is scales and measurements for terrestrial navigation you can survey with it the city of baghdad was surveyed with it it can be used for calculating mathematical equations of all different types and it would take a full university course to illustrate it astrolabes have an incredible history they are over 2,000 years old the concept of stereographic projection originated in 330 b.c and the astrolabes come in many different sizes and shapes and forms there is portable ones there is large display ones and i think what is common to all astrolabes is that they are beautiful works of art there is a quality of craftsmanship and precision that is just astonishing and remarkable astrolabes like every technology do evolve over time so the earliest retes for example were very simple and primitive and advancing retes became cultural emblems this is one from oxford and i find this one really extraordinary because the rete pattern is completely symmetrical and it accurately maps a completely asymmetrical or random sky how cool is that this is just amazing so would little lewis have an astrolabe probably not one made of brass he would have one made out of wood or paper and the vast majority of this first computer was a portable device that you could keep in the back of your pocket so what does the astrolabe inspire well i think the first thing is that it reminds us just how resourceful people were our forebears were years and years ago it 's just an incredible device every technology advances every technology is transformed and moved by others and what we gain with a new technology of course is precision and accuracy but what we lose i think is an accurate [UNK] a felt sense of the sky a sense of context knowing the sky knowing your relationship with the sky is the center of the real answer to knowing what time it is so it 's [UNK] i think astrolabes are just remarkable devices and so what can you learn from these devices well primarily that there is a subtle knowledge that we can connect with the world and astrolabes return us to this subtle sense of how things all fit together and also how we connect to the world thanks very much .what i want to tell you about today is how i see robots invading our lives at multiple levels over multiple timescales and when i look out in the future i ca n't imagine a world 500 years from now where we do n't have robots everywhere assuming [UNK] despite all the dire predictions from many people about our future [UNK] assuming we 're still around i ca n't imagine the world not being populated with robots and then the question is well if they 're going to be here in 500 years are they going to be everywhere sooner than that are they going to be around in 50 years yeah i think that 's pretty likely [UNK] there 's going to be lots of robots everywhere and in fact i think that 's going to be a lot sooner than that i think we 're sort of on the cusp of robots becoming common and i think we 're sort of around 1978 or 1980 in personal computer years where the first few robots are starting to appear computers sort of came around through games and toys and you know the first computer most people had in the house may have been a computer to play pong a little microprocessor embedded and then other games that came after that and we 're starting to see that same sort of thing with robots lego mindstorms furbies [UNK] who here [UNK] did anyone here have a furby yeah there 's 38 million of them sold worldwide they are pretty common and they 're a little tiny robot a simple robot with some sensors a little bit of processing actuation on the right there is another robot doll who you could get a couple of years ago and just as in the early days when there was a lot of sort of amateur interaction over computers you can now get various hacking kits how-to-hack books and on the left there is a platform from evolution robotics where you put a pc on and you program this thing with a gui to wander around your house and do various stuff and then there 's a higher price point sort of robot toys [UNK] the sony aibo and on the right there is one that the nec developed the papero which i do n't think they 're going to release but nevertheless those sorts of things are out there and we 've seen over the last two or three years lawn-mowing robots husqvarna on the bottom friendly robotics on top there an israeli company and then in the last 12 months or so we 've started to see a bunch of home-cleaning robots appear the top left one is a very nice home-cleaning robot from a company called dyson in the u.k except it was so expensive [UNK] 3,500 dollars [UNK] they did n't release it but at the bottom left you see electrolux which is on sale another one from karcher at the bottom right is one that i built in my lab about 10 years ago and we finally turned that into a product and let me just show you that we 're going to give this away i think chris said after the talk this is a robot that you can go out and buy and that will clean up your floor and it starts off sort of just going around in ever-increasing circles if it hits something [UNK] you people see that now it 's doing wall-following it 's following around my feet to clean up around me let 's see let 's [UNK] oh who stole my rice krispies they stole my rice krispies 1 do n't worry relax no relax it 's a robot it 's smart 1 see the three-year-old kids they do n't worry about it it 's grown-ups that get really upset we 'll just put some crap here okay i do n't know if you see [UNK] so i put a bunch of rice krispies there i put some pennies let 's just shoot it at that see if it cleans up yeah ok so [UNK] we 'll leave that for later part of the trick was building a better cleaning mechanism actually the intelligence on board was fairly simple and that 's true with a lot of robots we 've all i think become sort of computational chauvinists and think that computation is everything but the mechanics still matter here 's another robot the packbot that we 've been building for a bunch of years it 's a military surveillance robot to go in ahead of troops [UNK] looking at caves for instance but we had to make it fairly robust much more robust than the robots we build in our labs on board that robot is a pc running linux it can withstand a 400g shock the robot has local intelligence it can flip itself over can get itself into communication range can go upstairs by itself et cetera okay so it 's doing local navigation there a soldier gives it a command to go upstairs and it does that was not a controlled descent now it 's going to head off and the big breakthrough for these robots really was september 11th we had the robots down at the world trade center late that evening could n't do a lot in the main rubble pile things were just too [UNK] there was nothing left to do but we did go into all the surrounding buildings that had been evacuated and searched for possible survivors in the buildings that were too dangerous to go into let 's run this video reporter 1 battlefield companions are helping to reduce the combat risks nick robertson has that story rodney brooks can we have another one of these okay good so this is a corporal who had seen a robot two weeks previously he 's sending robots into caves looking at what 's going on the robot 's being totally autonomous the worst thing that 's happened in the cave so far was one of the robots fell down ten meters so one year ago the us military did n't have these robots now they 're on active duty in afghanistan every day and that 's one of the reasons they say a robot invasion is happening there 's a sea change happening in how [UNK] where technology 's going thanks and over the next couple of months we 're going to be sending robots in production down producing oil wells to get that last few years of oil out of the ground very hostile environments 150˚ c 10,000 psi autonomous robots going down doing this sort of work but robots like this they 're a little hard to program how in the future are we going to program our robots and make them easier to use and i want to actually use a robot here [UNK] a robot named chris [UNK] stand up yeah okay come over here now notice he thinks robots have to be a bit stiff he sort of does that but i 'm going to [UNK] chris anderson i 'm just british rb oh i 'm going to show this robot a task it 's a very complex task now notice he nodded there he was giving me some indication he was understanding the flow of communication and if i 'd said something completely bizarre he would have looked askance at me and regulated the conversation so now i brought this up in front of him i 'd looked at his eyes and i saw his eyes looked at this bottle top and i 'm doing this task here and he 's checking up his eyes are going back and forth up to me to see what i 'm looking at [UNK] so we 've got shared attention and so i do this task and he looks and he looks to me to see what 's happening next and now i 'll give him the bottle and we 'll see if he can do the task can you do that okay he 's pretty good yeah good good good i did n't show you how to do that now see if you can put it back together and he thinks a robot has to be really slow good robot that 's good so we saw a bunch of things there we saw when we 're interacting we 're trying to show someone how to do something we direct their visual attention the other thing communicates their internal state to us whether he 's understanding or not regulates a social interaction there was shared attention looking at the same sort of thing and recognizing socially communicated reinforcement at the end and we 've been trying to put that into our lab robots because we think this is how you 're going to want to interact with robots in the future i just want to show you one technical diagram here the most important thing for building a robot that you can interact with socially is its visual attention system because what it pays attention to is what it 's seeing and interacting with and what you 're understanding what it 's doing so in the videos i 'm about to show you you 're going to see a visual attention system on a robot which has [UNK] it looks for skin tone in hsv space so it works across all human colorings it looks for highly saturated colors from toys and it looks for things that move around and it weights those together into an attention window and it looks for the highest-scoring place [UNK] the stuff where the most interesting stuff is happening [UNK] and that is what its eyes then segue to and it looks right at that at the same time some top-down sort of stuff might decide that it 's lonely and look for skin tone or might decide that it 's bored and look for a toy to play with and so these weights change and over here on the right this is what we call the steven spielberg memorial module did people see the movie " ai " rb yeah it was really bad but [UNK] remember especially when haley joel osment the little robot looked at the blue fairy for 2,000 years without taking his eyes off it well this gets rid of that because this is a habituation gaussian that gets negative and more and more intense as it looks at one thing and it gets bored so it will then look away at something else so once you 've got that [UNK] and here 's a robot here 's kismet looking around for a toy you can tell what it 's looking at you can estimate its gaze direction from those eyeballs covering its camera and you can tell when it 's actually seeing the toy and it 's got a little bit of an emotional response here but it 's still going to pay attention if something more significant comes into its field of view [UNK] such as cynthia breazeal the builder of this robot from the right it sees her pays attention to her kismet has an underlying three-dimensional emotional space a vector space of where it is emotionally and at different places in that space it expresses [UNK] can we have the volume on here can you hear that now out there kismet do you really think so do you really think so do you really think so rb so it 's expressing its emotion through its face and the prosody in its voice and when i was dealing with my robot over here chris the robot was measuring the prosody in my voice and so we have the robot measure prosody for four basic messages that mothers give their children pre-linguistically here we 've got naive subjects praising the robot voice nice robot you 're such a cute little robot rb and the robot 's reacting appropriately voice 1 very good kismet voice look at my smile rb it smiles she imitates the smile this happens a lot these are naive subjects here we asked them to get the robot 's attention and indicate when they have the robot 's attention voice hey kismet ah there it is rb so she realizes she has the robot 's attention voice kismet do you like the toy oh rb now here they 're asked to prohibit the robot and this first woman really pushes the robot into an emotional corner voice no no you 're not to do that no not appropriate no no rb i 'm going to leave it at that we put that together then we put in turn taking when we talk to someone we talk then we sort of raise our eyebrows move our eyes give the other person the idea it 's their turn to talk and then they talk and then we pass the baton back and forth between each other so we put this in the robot we got a bunch of naive subjects in we did n't tell them anything about the robot sat them down in front of the robot and said talk to the robot now what they did n't know was the robot was n't understanding a word they said and that the robot was n't speaking english it was just saying random english phonemes and i want you to watch carefully at the beginning of this where this person ritchie who happened to talk to the robot for 25 minutes [UNK] [UNK] says " i want to show you something i want to show you my watch " and he brings the watch center into the robot 's field of vision points to it gives it a motion cue and the robot looks at the watch quite successfully we do n't know whether he understood or not that the robot [UNK] notice the turn-taking ritchie ok i want to show you something ok this is a watch that my girlfriend gave me robot oh cool ritchie yeah look it 's got a little blue light in it too i almost lost it this week rb so it 's making eye contact with him following his eyes ritchie can you do the same thing robot yeah sure rb and they successfully have that sort of communication and here 's another aspect of the sorts of things that chris and i were doing this is another robot cog they first make eye contact and then when christie looks over at this toy the robot estimates her gaze direction and looks at the same thing that she 's looking at so we 're going to see more and more of this sort of robot over the next few years in labs but then the big questions two big questions that people ask me are if we make these robots more and more human-like will we accept them will we [UNK] will they need rights eventually and the other question people ask me is will they want to take over and on the first [UNK] you know this has been a very hollywood theme with lots of movies you probably recognize these characters here [UNK] where in each of these cases the robots want more respect well do you ever need to give robots respect they 're just machines after all but i think you know we have to accept that we are just machines after all that 's certainly what modern molecular biology says about us you do n't see a description of how you know molecule a you know comes up and docks with this other molecule and it 's moving forward you know propelled by various charges and then the soul steps in and tweaks those molecules so that they connect it 's all mechanistic we are mechanism if we are machines then in principle at least we should be able to build machines out of other stuff which are just as alive as we are but i think for us to admit that we have to give up on our special-ness in a certain way and we 've had the retreat from special-ness under the barrage of science and technology many times over the last few hundred years at least 500 years ago we had to give up the idea that we are the center of the universe when the earth started to go around the sun 150 years ago with darwin we had to give up the idea we were different from animals and to imagine [UNK] you know it 's always hard for us recently we 've been battered with the idea that maybe we did n't even have our own creation event here on earth which people did n't like much and then the human genome said maybe we only have 35,000 genes and that was really [UNK] people did n't like that we 've got more genes than that we do n't like to give up our special-ness so you know having the idea that robots could really have emotions or that robots could be living creatures [UNK] i think is going to be hard for us to accept but we 're going to come to accept it over the next 50 years or so and the second question is will the machines want to take over and here the standard scenario is that we create these things they grow we nurture them they learn a lot from us and then they start to decide that we 're pretty boring slow they want to take over from us and for those of you that have teenagers you know what that 's like but hollywood extends it to the robots and the question is you know will someone accidentally build a robot that takes over from us and that 's sort of like this lone guy in the backyard you know [UNK] " i accidentally built a 747 " i do n't think that 's going to happen and i do n't think [UNK] [UNK] i do n't think we 're going to deliberately build robots that we 're uncomfortable with we 'll [UNK] you know they 're not going to have a super bad robot before that has to come to be a mildly bad robot and before that a not so bad robot and we 're just not going to let it go that way so i think i 'm going to leave it at that the robots are coming we do n't have too much to worry about it 's going to be a lot of fun and i hope you all enjoy the journey over the next 50 years .i 'm speaking about compassion from an islamic point of view and perhaps my faith is not very well thought of as being one that is grounded in compassion the truth of the matter is otherwise our holy book the koran consists of 114 chapters and each chapter begins with what we call the basmala the saying of " in the name of god the all compassionate the all merciful " or as sir richard burton [UNK] not the richard burton who was married to elizabeth taylor but the sir richard burton who lived a century before that and who was a worldwide traveler and translator of many works of literature [UNK] translates it " in the name of god the compassionating the compassionate " and in a saying of the koran which to muslims is god speaking to humanity god says to his prophet muhammad [UNK] whom we believe to be the last of a series of prophets beginning with adam including noah including moses including abraham including jesus christ and ending with muhammad [UNK] that " we have not sent you o muhammad except as a 'rahmah ' except as a source of compassion to humanity " for us human beings and certainly for us as muslims whose mission and whose purpose in following the path of the prophet is to make ourselves as much like the prophet and the prophet in one of his sayings said " adorn yourselves with the attributes of god " and because god himself said that the primary attribute of his is compassion [UNK] in fact the koran says that " god decreed upon himself compassion " or " reigned himself in by compassion " [UNK] therefore our objective and our mission must be to be sources of compassion activators of compassion actors of compassion and speakers of compassion and doers of compassion that is all well and good but where do we go wrong and what is the source of the lack of compassion in the world for the answer to this we turn to our spiritual path in every religious tradition there is the outer path and the inner path or the exoteric path and the esoteric path the esoteric path of islam is more popularly known as sufism or " tasawwuf " in arabic and these doctors or these masters these spiritual masters of the sufi tradition refer to teachings and examples of our prophet that teach us where the source of our problems lies in one of the battles that the prophet waged he told his followers " we are returning from the lesser war to the greater war to the greater battle " and they said " messenger of god we are battle-weary how can we go to a greater battle " he said " that is the battle of the self the battle of the ego " the sources of human problems have to do with egotism " i " the famous sufi master rumi who is very well known to most of you has a story in which he talks of a man who goes to the house of a friend and he knocks on the door and a voice answers " who 's there " " it 's me " or more grammatically correctly " it is i " as we might say in english the voice says " go away " after many years of training of disciplining of search and struggle he comes back with much greater humility he knocks again on the door the voice asks " who is there " he said " it is you o heartbreaker " the door swings open and the voice says " come in for there is no room in this house for two i 's " [UNK] two capital i 's not these eyes [UNK] " for two egos " and rumi 's stories are metaphors for the spiritual path in the presence of god there is no room for more than one " i " and that is the " i " of divinity in a teaching [UNK] called a " hadith qudsi " in our tradition [UNK] god says that " my servant " or " my creature my human creature does not approach me by anything that is dearer to me than what i have asked them to do " and those of you who are employers know exactly what i mean you want your employees to do what you ask them to do and if they 've done that then they can do extra but do n't ignore what you 've asked them to do " and " god says " my servant continues to get nearer to me by doing more of what i 've asked them to do " [UNK] extra credit we might call it [UNK] " until i love him or love her and when i love my servant " god says " i become the eyes by which he or she sees the ears by which he or she listens the hand by which he or she grasps and the foot by which he or she walks and the heart by which he or she understands " it is this merging of our self with divinity that is the lesson and purpose of our spiritual path and all of our faith traditions muslims regard jesus as the master of sufism the greatest prophet and messenger who came to emphasize the spiritual path when he says " i am the spirit and i am the way " and when the prophet muhammad said " whoever has seen me has seen god " it is because they became so much an instrument of god they became part of god 's team [UNK] so that god 's will was manifest through them and they were not acting from their own selves and their own egos compassion on earth is given it is in us all we have to do is to get our egos out of the way get our egotism out of the way i 'm sure probably all of you here or certainly the very vast majority of you have had what you might call a spiritual experience a moment in your lives when for a few seconds a minute perhaps the boundaries of your ego dissolved and at that minute you felt at one with the universe [UNK] one with that jug of water one with every human being one with the creator [UNK] and you felt you were in the presence of power of awe of the deepest love the deepest sense of compassion and mercy that you have ever experienced in your lives that is a moment which is a gift of god to us [UNK] a gift when for a moment he lifts that boundary which makes us insist on " i i i me me me " and instead like the person in rumi 's story we say " oh this is all you this is all you and this is all us and us and i and us are all part of you o creator 1 o the objective 1 the source of our being and the end of our journey you are also the breaker of our hearts you are the one whom we should all be towards for whose purpose we live and for whose purpose we shall die and for whose purpose we shall be resurrected again to account to god to what extent we have been compassionate beings " our message today and our purpose today and those of you who are here today and the purpose of this charter of compassion is to remind for the koran always urges us to remember to remind each other because the knowledge of truth is within every human being we know it all we have access to it all jung may have called it " the subconscious " through our subconscious in your dreams [UNK] the koran calls our state of sleep " the lesser death " " the temporary death " [UNK] in our state of sleep we have dreams we have visions we travel even outside of our bodies for many of us and we see wonderful things we travel beyond the limitations of space as we know it and beyond the limitations of time as we know it but all this is for us to glorify the name of the creator whose primary name is the compassionating the compassionate god bokh whatever name you want to call him with allah ram om whatever the name might be through which you name or access the presence of divinity it is the locus of absolute being absolute love and mercy and compassion and absolute knowledge and wisdom what hindus call " satchidananda " the language differs but the objective is the same rumi has another story about three men a turk an arab and [UNK] and i forget the third person but for my sake it could be a malay one is asking for angur [UNK] one is say an englishman [UNK] one is asking for eneb and one is asking for grapes and they have a fight and an argument because [UNK] " i want grapes " " i want eneb " i want angur " [UNK] not knowing that the word that they 're using refers to the same reality in different languages there 's only one absolute reality by definition one absolute being by definition because absolute is by definition single and absolute and singular there 's this absolute concentration of being the absolute concentration of consciousness awareness an absolute locus of compassion and love that defines the primary attributes of divinity and these should also be the primary attributes of what it means to be human for what defines humanity perhaps biologically is our physiology but god defines humanity by our spirituality by our nature and the koran says he speaks to the angels and says " when i have finished the formation of adam from clay and breathed into him of my spirit then fall in prostration to him " the angels prostrate not before the human body but before the human soul why because the soul the human soul embodies a piece of the divine breath a piece of the divine soul this is also expressed in biblical vocabulary when we are taught that we were created in the divine image what is the imagery of god the imagery of god is absolute being absolute awareness and knowledge and wisdom and absolute compassion and love and therefore for us to be human [UNK] in the greatest sense of what it means to be human in the most joyful sense of what it means to be human [UNK] means that we too have to be proper stewards of the breath of divinity within us and seek to perfect within ourselves the attribute of being of being alive of beingness the attribute of wisdom of consciousness of awareness and the attribute of being compassionate and loving beings this is what i understand from my faith tradition and this is what i understand from my studies of other faith traditions and this is the common platform on which we must all stand and when we stand on this platform as such i am convinced that we can make a wonderful world and i believe personally that we 're on the verge and that with the presence and help of people like you here we can bring about the prophecy of isaiah for he foretold of a period when people shall transform their swords into plowshares and will not learn war or make war anymore we have reached a stage in human history that we have no option we must we must lower our egos control our egos [UNK] whether it is individual ego personal ego family ego national ego [UNK] and let all be for the glorification of the one thank you and god bless you .delighted to be here and to talk to you about a subject dear to my heart which is beauty i do the philosophy of art aesthetics actually for a living i try to figure out intellectually philosophically psychologically what the experience of beauty is what sensibly can be said about it and how people go off the rails in trying to understand it now this is an extremely complicated subject in part because the things that we call beautiful are so different i mean just think of the sheer variety [UNK] a baby 's face berlioz 's " harold in italy " movies like " the wizard of oz " or the plays of chekhov a central california landscape a hokusai view of mt fuji " der rosenkavalier " a stunning match-winning goal in a world cup soccer match van gogh 's " starry night " a jane austen novel fred astaire dancing across the screen this brief list includes human beings natural landforms works of art and skilled human actions an account that explains the presence of beauty in everything on this list is not going to be easy i can however give you at least a taste of what i regard as the most powerful theory of beauty we yet have and we get it not from a philosopher of art not from a postmodern art theorist or a bigwig art critic no this theory comes from an expert on barnacles and worms and pigeon breeding and you know who i mean charles darwin of course a lot of people think they already know the proper answer to the question " what is beauty " it 's in the eye of the beholder it 's whatever moves you personally or as some people especially academics prefer beauty is in the culturally conditioned eye of the beholder people agree that paintings or movies or music are beautiful because their cultures determine a uniformity of aesthetic taste taste for both natural beauty and for the arts travel across cultures with great ease beethoven is adored in japan peruvians love japanese woodblock prints inca sculptures are regarded as treasures in british museums while shakespeare is translated into every major language of the earth or just think about american jazz or american movies [UNK] they go everywhere there are many differences among the arts but there are also universal cross-cultural aesthetic pleasures and values how can we explain this universality the best answer lies in trying to reconstruct a darwinian evolutionary history of our artistic and aesthetic tastes we need to reverse-engineer our present artistic tastes and preferences and explain how they came to be engraved in our minds by the actions of both our prehistoric largely pleistocene environments where we became fully human but also by the social situations in which we evolved this reverse engineering can also enlist help from the human record preserved in prehistory i mean fossils cave paintings and so forth and it should take into account what we know of the aesthetic interests of isolated hunter-gatherer bands that survived into the 19th and the 20th centuries now i personally have no doubt whatsoever that the experience of beauty with its emotional intensity and pleasure belongs to our evolved human psychology the experience of beauty is one component in a whole series of darwinian adaptations beauty is an adaptive effect which we extend and intensify in the creation and enjoyment of works of art and entertainment as many of you will know evolution operates by two main primary mechanisms the first of these is natural selection [UNK] that 's random mutation and selective retention [UNK] along with our basic anatomy and physiology [UNK] the evolution of the pancreas or the eye or the fingernails natural selection also explains many basic revulsions such as the horrid smell of rotting meat or fears such as the fear of snakes or standing close to the edge of a cliff natural selection also explains pleasures [UNK] sexual pleasure our liking for sweet fat and proteins which in turn explains a lot of popular foods from ripe fruits through chocolate malts and barbecued ribs the other great principle of evolution is sexual selection and it operates very differently the peacock 's magnificent tail is the most famous example of this it did not evolve for natural survival in fact it goes against natural survival no the peacock 's tail results from the mating choices made by peahens it 's quite a familiar story it 's women who actually push history forward darwin himself by the way had no doubts that the peacock 's tail was beautiful in the eyes of the peahen he actually used that word now keeping these ideas firmly in mind we can say that the experience of beauty is one of the ways that evolution has of arousing and sustaining interest or fascination even obsession in order to encourage us toward making the most adaptive decisions for survival and reproduction beauty is nature 's way of acting at a distance so to speak i mean you ca n't expect to eat an adaptively beneficial landscape it would hardly do to eat your baby or your lover so evolution 's trick is to make them beautiful to have them exert a kind of magnetism to give you the pleasure of simply looking at them consider briefly an important source of aesthetic pleasure the magnetic pull of beautiful landscapes people in very different cultures all over the world tend to like a particular kind of landscape a landscape that just happens to be similar to the pleistocene savannas where we evolved this landscape shows up today on calendars on postcards in the design of golf courses and public parks and in gold-framed pictures that hang in living rooms from new york to new zealand it 's a kind of hudson river school landscape featuring open spaces of low grasses interspersed with copses of trees the trees by the way are often preferred if they fork near the ground that is to say if they 're trees you could scramble up if you were in a tight fix the landscape shows the presence of water directly in view or evidence of water in a bluish distance indications of animal or bird life as well as diverse greenery and finally [UNK] get this [UNK] a path or a road perhaps a riverbank or a shoreline that extends into the distance almost inviting you to follow it this landscape type is regarded as beautiful even by people in countries that do n't have it the ideal savanna landscape is one of the clearest examples where human beings everywhere find beauty in similar visual experience but someone might argue that 's natural beauty how about artistic beauty is n't that exhaustively cultural no i do n't think it is and once again i 'd like to look back to prehistory to say something about it it is widely assumed that the earliest human artworks are the stupendously skillful cave paintings that we all know from lascaux and chauvet chauvet caves are about 32,000 years old along with a few small realistic sculptures of women and animals from the same period but artistic and decorative skills are actually much older than that beautiful shell necklaces that look like something you 'd see at an arts and crafts fair as well as ochre body paint have been found from around 100,000 years ago but the most intriguing prehistoric artifacts are older even than this i have in mind the so-called acheulian hand axes the oldest stone tools are choppers from the olduvai gorge in east africa they go back about two-and-a-half-million years these crude tools were around for thousands of centuries until around 1.4 million years ago when homo erectus started shaping single thin stone blades sometimes rounded ovals but often in what are to our eyes an arresting symmetrical pointed leaf or teardrop form these acheulian hand axes [UNK] they 're named after st. acheul in france where finds were made in 19th century [UNK] have been unearthed in their thousands scattered across asia europe and africa almost everywhere homo erectus and homo ergaster roamed now the sheer numbers of these hand axes shows that they ca n't have been made for butchering animals and the plot really thickens when you realize that unlike other pleistocene tools the hand axes often exhibit no evidence of wear on their delicate blade edges and some in any event are too big to use for butchery their symmetry their attractive materials and above all their meticulous workmanship are simply quite beautiful to our eyes even today so what were these ancient [UNK] i mean they 're ancient they 're foreign but they 're at the same time somehow familiar what were these artifacts for the best available answer is that they were literally the earliest known works of art practical tools transformed into captivating aesthetic objects contemplated both for their elegant shape and their virtuoso craftsmanship hand axes mark an evolutionary advance in human history [UNK] tools fashioned to function as what darwinians call " fitness signals " [UNK] that is to say displays that are performances like the peacock 's tail except that unlike hair and feathers the hand axes are consciously cleverly crafted competently made hand axes indicated desirable personal qualities [UNK] intelligence fine motor control planning ability conscientiousness and sometimes access to rare materials over tens of thousands of generations such skills increased the status of those who displayed them and gained a reproductive advantage over the less capable you know it 's an old line but it has been shown to work [UNK] " why do n't you come up to my cave so i can show you my hand axes " except of course what 's interesting about this is that we ca n't be sure how that idea was conveyed because the homo erectus that made these objects did not have language it 's hard to grasp but it 's an incredible fact this object was made by a hominid ancestor homo erectus or homo ergaster between 50,000 and 100,000 years before language stretching over a million years the hand axe tradition is the longest artistic tradition in human and proto-human history by the end of the hand axe epic homo sapiens [UNK] as they were then called finally [UNK] were doubtless finding new ways to amuse and amaze each other by who knows telling jokes storytelling dancing or hairstyling yes hairstyling [UNK] i insist on that for us moderns virtuoso technique is used to create imaginary worlds in fiction and in movies to express intense emotions with music painting and dance but still one fundamental trait of the ancestral personality persists in our aesthetic cravings the beauty we find in skilled performances from lascaux to the louvre to carnegie hall human beings have a permanent innate taste for virtuoso displays in the arts we find beauty in something done well so the next time you pass a jewelry shop window displaying a beautifully cut teardrop-shaped stone do n't be so sure it 's just your culture telling you that that sparkling jewel is beautiful your distant ancestors loved that shape and found beauty in the skill needed to make it even before they could put their love into words is beauty in the eye of the beholder no it 's deep in our minds it 's a gift handed down from the intelligent skills and rich emotional lives of our most ancient ancestors our powerful reaction to images to the expression of emotion in art to the beauty of music to the night sky will be with us and our descendants for as long as the human race exists thank you transcript urlhttpwww.ted.comtalksdennis_hong_making_a_car_for_blind_drivers.htmlurl descriptionUsing robotics, laser rangefinders, GPS and smart feedback tools, Dennis Hong is building a car for drivers who are blind. It's not a "self-driving" car, he's careful to note, but a car in which a non-sighted driver can determine speed, proximity and route -- and drive independently.description keywordsdesign,technology,transportationkeywords talkid1158talkid titleDennis Hong Making a car for blind driverstitle transcript many believe driving is an activity solely reserved for those who can see a blind person driving a vehicle safely and independently was thought to be an impossible task until now hello my name is dennis hong and we 're bringing freedom and independence to the blind by building a vehicle for the visually impaired so before i talk about this car for the blind let me briefly tell you about another project that i worked on called the darpa urban challenge now this was about building a robotic car that can drive itself you press start nobody touches anything and it can reach its destination fully autonomously so in 2007 our team won half a million dollars by placing third place in this competition so about that time the national federation of the blind or nfb challenged the research committee about who can develop a car that lets a blind person drive safely and independently we decided to give it a try because we thought " hey how hard could it be " we have already an autonomous vehicle we just put a blind person in it and we 're done right we could n't have been more wrong what nfb wanted was not a vehicle that can drive a blind person around but a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive so we had to throw everything out the window and start from scratch so to test this crazy idea we developed a small dune buggy prototype vehicle to test the feasibility and in the summer of 2009 we invited dozens of blind youth from all over the country and gave them a chance to take it for a spin it was an absolutely amazing experience but the problem with this car was it was designed to only be driven in a very controlled environment in a flat closed-off parking lot [UNK] even the lanes defined by red traffic cones so with this success we decided to take the next big step to develop a real car that can be driven on real roads so how does it work well it 's a rather complex system but let me try to explain it maybe simplify it so we have three steps we have perception computation and non-visual interfaces now obviously the driver can not see so the system needs to perceive the environment and gather information for the driver for that we use an initial measurement unit so it measures acceleration angular acceleration [UNK] like a human ear inner ear we fuse that information with a gps unit to get an estimate of the location of the car we also use two cameras to detect the lanes of the road and we also use three laser range finders the lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles [UNK] a car approaching from the front the back and also any obstacles that run into the roads any obstacles around the vehicle so all this vast amount of information is then fed into the computer and the computer can do two things one is first of all process this information to have an understanding of the environment [UNK] these are the lanes of the road there 's the obstacles [UNK] and convey this information to the driver the system is also smart enough to figure out the safest way to operate the car so we can also generate instructions on how to operate the controls of the vehicle but the problem is this how do we convey this information and instructions to a person who can not see fast enough and accurate enough so he can drive so for this we developed many different types of non-visual user interface technology so starting from a three-dimensional ping sound system a vibrating vest a click wheel with voice commands a leg strip even a shoe that applies pressure to the foot but today we 're going to talk about three of these non-visual user interfaces now the first interface is called a drivegrip so these are a pair of gloves and it has vibrating elements on the knuckle part so you can convey instructions about how to steer [UNK] the direction and the intensity another device is called speedstrip so this is a chair [UNK] as a matter of fact it 's actually a massage chair we gut it out and we rearrange the vibrating elements in different patterns and we actuate them to convey information about the speed and also instructions how to use the gas and the brake pedal so over here you can see how the computer understands the environment and because you can not see the vibration we actually put red led 's on the driver so that you can see what 's happening this is the sensory data and that data is transferred to the devices through the computer so these two devices drivegrip and speedstrip are very effective but the problem is these are instructional cue devices so this is not really freedom right the computer tells you how to drive [UNK] turn left turn right speed up stop we call this the " backseat-driver problem " so we 're moving away from the instructional cue devices and we 're now focusing more on the informational devices a good example for this informational non-visual user interface is called airpix so think of it as a monitor for the blind so it 's a small tablet has many holes in it and compressed air comes out so it can actually draw images so even though you are blind you can put your hand over it you can see the lanes of the road and obstacles actually you can also change the frequency of the air coming out and possibly the temperature so it 's actually a multi-dimensional user interface so here you can see the left camera the right camera from the vehicle and how the computer interprets that and sends that information to the airpix for this we 're showing a simulator a blind person driving using the airpix this simulator was also very useful for training the blind drivers and also quickly testing different types of ideas for different types of non-visual user interfaces so basically that 's how it works so just a month ago on january 29th we unveiled this vehicle for the very first time to the public at the world-famous daytona international speedway during the rolex 24 racing event we also had some surprises let 's take a look announcer this is an historic day in january he 's coming up to the grandstand fellow federationists there 's the grandstand now and he 's [ unclear ] following that van that 's out in front of him well there comes the first box now let 's see if mark avoids it he does he passes it on the right third box is out the fourth box is out and he 's perfectly making his way between the two he 's closing in on the van to make the moving pass well this is what it 's all about this kind of dynamic display of audacity and ingenuity he 's approaching the end of the run makes his way between the barrels that are set up there dennis hong i 'm so happy for you mark 's going to give me a ride back to the hotel mark riccobono yes dh so since we started this project we 've been getting hundreds of letters emails phone calls from people from all around the world letters thanking us but sometimes you also get funny letters like this one " now i understand why there is braille on a drive-up atm machine " but sometimes [UNK] but sometimes i also do get [UNK] i would n't call it hate mail [UNK] but letters of really strong concern " dr. hong are you insane trying to put blind people on the road you must be out of your mind " but this vehicle is a prototype vehicle and it 's not going to be on the road until it 's proven as safe as or safer than today 's vehicle and i truly believe that this can happen but still will the society would they accept such a radical idea how are we going to handle insurance how are we going to issue driver 's licenses there 's many of these different kinds of hurdles besides technology challenges that we need to address before this becomes a reality of course the main goal of this project is to develop a car for the blind but potentially more important than this is the tremendous value of the spin-off technology that can come from this project the sensors that are used can see through the dark the fog and rain and together with this new type of interfaces we can use these technologies and apply them to safer cars for sighted people or for the blind everyday home appliances [UNK] in the educational setting in the office setting just imagine in a classroom a teacher writes on the blackboard and a blind student can see what 's written and read using these non-visual interfaces this is priceless so today the things i 've showed you today is just the beginning thank you very much .i 'm here today to share with you an extraordinary journey [UNK] extraordinarily rewarding journey actually [UNK] which brought me into training rats to save human lives by detecting landmines and tuberculosis as a child i had two passions one was a passion for rodents i had all kinds of rats mice hamsters gerbils squirrels you name it i bred it and i sold them to pet shops i also had a passion for africa growing up in a multicultural environment we had african students in the house and i learned about their stories so different backgrounds dependency on imported know-how goods services exuberant cultural diversity africa was truly fascinating for me i became an industrial engineer engineer in product development and i focused on appropriate detection technologies actually the first appropriate technologies for developing countries i started working in the industry but i was n't really happy to contribute to a material consumer society in a linear extracting and manufacturing mode i quit my job to focus on the real world problem landmines we 're talking '95 now princess diana is announcing on tv that landmines form a structural barrier to any development which is really true as long as these devices are there or there is suspicion of landmines you ca n't really enter into the land actually there was an appeal worldwide for new detectors in the sustainable environments where they 're needed to produce which is mainly in the developing world we chose rats why would you choose rats because are n't they vermin well actually rats are in contrary to what most people think about them rats are highly sociable creatures and actually our product [UNK] what you see here there 's a target somewhere here you see an operator a trained african with his rats in front who actually are left and right there the animal finds a mine it scratches on the soil and the animal comes back for a food reward very very simple very sustainable in this environment here the animal gets its food reward and that 's how it works very very simple now why would you use rats rats have been used since the '50s last century in all kinds of experiments rats have more genetic material allocated to olfaction than any other mammal species they 're extremely sensitive to smell moreover they have the mechanisms to map all these smells and to communicate about it now how do we communicate with rats well do n't talk rat but we have a clicker a standard method for animal training which you see there a clicker which makes a particular sound with which you can reinforce particular behaviors first of all we associate the click sound with a food reward which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe once the animal knows click food click food click food [UNK] so click is food [UNK] we bring it in a cage with a hole and actually the animal learns to stick the nose in the hole under which a target scent is placed and to do that for five seconds [UNK] five seconds which is long for a rat once the animal knows this we make the task a bit more difficult it learns how to find the target smell in a cage with several holes up to 10 holes then the animal learns to walk on a leash in the open and find targets in the next step animals learn to find real mines in real minefields they are tested and accredited according to international mine action standards just like dogs have to pass a test this consists of 400 square meters there 's a number of mines placed blindly and the team of trainer and their rat have to find all the targets if the animal does that it gets a license as an accredited animal to be operational in the field [UNK] just like dogs by the way maybe one slight difference we can train rats at a fifth of the price of training the mining dog this is our team in mozambique one tanzanian trainer who transfers the skills to these three mozambican fellows and you should see the pride in the eyes of these people they have a skill which makes them much less dependent on foreign aid moreover this small team together with of course you need the heavy vehicles and the manual de-miners to follow-up but with this small investment in a rat capacity we have demonstrated in mozambique that we can reduce the cost-price per square meter up to 60 percent of what is currently normal [UNK] two dollars per square meter we do it at $ 1.18 and we can still bring that price down question of scale if you can bring in more rats we can actually make the output even bigger we have a demonstration site in mozambique eleven african governments have seen that they can become less dependent by using this technology they have signed the pact for peace and treaty in the great lakes region and they endorse hero rats to clear their common borders of landmines but let me bring you to a very different problem and there 's about 6,000 people last year that walked on a landmine but worldwide last year almost 1.9 million died from tuberculosis as a first cause of infection especially in africa where t.b and hiv are strongly linked there is a huge common problem microscopy the standard who procedure reaches from 40 to 60 percent reliability in tanzania [UNK] the numbers do n't lie [UNK] 45 percent of people [UNK] t.b patients [UNK] get diagnosed with t.b before they die it means that if you have t.b. you have more chance that you wo n't be detected but will just die from t.b secondary infections and so on and if however you are detected very early diagnosed early treatment can start and even in hiv-positives it makes sense you can actually cure t.b. even in hiv-positives so in our common language dutch the name for t.b is " tering " which etymologically refers to the smell of tar already the old chinese and the greek hippocrates have actually published documented that t.b can be diagnosed based on the volatiles exuding from patients so what we did is we collected some samples [UNK] just as a way of testing [UNK] from hospitals trained rats on them and see if this works and wonder well we can reach 89 percent sensitivity 86 percent specificity using multiple rats in a row this is how it works and really this is a generic technology we 're talking now explosives tuberculosis but can you imagine you can actually put anything under there so how does it work you have a cassette with 10 samples you put these 10 samples at once in the cage an animal only needs two hundredths of a second to discriminate the scent so it goes extremely fast here it 's already at the third sample this is a positive sample it gets a click sound and comes for the food reward and by doing so very fast we can have like a second-line opinion to see which patients are positive which are negative just as an indication whereas a microscopist can process 40 samples in a day a rat can process the same amount of samples in seven minutes only a cage like this [UNK] a cage like this [UNK] provided that you have rats and we have now currently 25 tuberculosis rats [UNK] a cage like this operating throughout the day can process 1,680 samples can you imagine the potential offspring applications [UNK] environmental detection of pollutants in soils customs applications detection of illicit goods in containers and so on but let 's stick first to tuberculosis i just want to briefly highlight the blue rods are the scores of microscopy only at the five clinics in dar es salaam on a population of 500,000 people where 15,000 reported to get a test done microscopy for 1,800 patients and by just presenting the samples once more to the rats and looping those results back we were able to increase case detection rates by over 30 percent throughout last year we 've been [UNK] depending on which intervals you take [UNK] we 've been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in dar es salaam between 30 and 40 percent so this is really considerable knowing that a missed patient by microscopy infects up to 15 people healthy people per year you can be sure that we have saved lots of lives at least our hero rats have saved lots of lives the way forward for us is now to standardize this technology and there are simple things like for instance we have a small laser in the sniffer hole where the animal has to stick for five seconds so to standardize this also to standardize the pellets the food rewards and to semi-automate this in order to replicate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people to conclude there are also other applications at the horizon here is a first prototype of our camera rat which is a rat with a rat backpack with a camera that can go under rubble to detect for victims after earthquake and so on this is in a prototype stage we do n't have a working system here yet to conclude i would actually like to say you may think this is about rats these projects but in the end it is about people it is about empowering vulnerable communities to tackle difficult expensive and dangerous humanitarian detection tasks and doing that with a local resource plenty available so something completely different is to keep on challenging your perception about the resources surrounding you whether they are environmental technological animal or human and to respectfully harmonize with them in order to foster a sustainable work thank you very much .kurt andersen like many architects david is a hog for the limelight but is sufficiently reticent [UNK] or at least pretends to be [UNK] that he asked me to question him rather than speaking in fact what we 're going to talk about i think is in fact a subject that is probably better served by a conversation than an address and i guess we have a bit of news clip to precede dan rather since the september 11th attack on the world trade center many people have flocked to downtown new york to see and pay respects at what amounts to the 16-acre burial ground now as cbs 's jim axelrod reports they 're putting the finishing touches on a new way for people to visit and view the scene jim axelrod forget the empire state building or the statue of liberty there 's a new place in new york where the crowds are thickest [UNK] ground zero tourist i 've taken my step-daughter here from indianapolis this was [UNK] out of all the tourist sites in new york city [UNK] this was her number-one pick ja thousands now line up on lower broadway tourist i 've been wanting to come down here since this happened ja even on the coldest winter days to honor and remember tourist it 's reality it 's us it happened here this is ours ja so many in fact that seeing has become a bit of a problem tourist i think that people are very frustrated that they 're not able to get closer to see what 's going on ja but that is about to change in record time a team of architects and construction workers designed and built a viewing platform to ease the frustration and bring people closer man they 'll get an incredible panorama and understand i think more completely the sheer totality of the destruction of the place ja if you think about it ground zero is unlike most any other tourist site in america unlike the grand canyon or the washington monument people come here to see what 's no longer there david rockwell the first experience people will have here when they see this is not as a construction site but as this incredibly moving burial ground ja the walls are bare by design so people can fill them with their own memorials the way they already have along the current perimeter tourist from our hearts it affected us just as much ja the ramps are made of simple material [UNK] the kind of plywood you see at construction sites [UNK] which is really the whole point in the face of america 's worst destruction people are building again jim axelrod cbs news new york ka this is not an obvious subject to be in the sensuality segment but certainly david you are known as [UNK] i know a phrase you hate [UNK] an entertainment architect your work is highly sensual even hedonistic dr i like that word ka it 's about pleasure [UNK] casinos and hotels and restaurants how did the shock that all of us [UNK] and especially all of us in new york [UNK] felt on the 11th of september transmute into your desire to do this thing dr well the truth of the matter is post-september 11th i felt myself in the role originally [UNK] first of all as someone who lives in tribeca and whose neighborhood was devastated and as someone who works less than a mile from there [UNK] that i was in the role of forcing 100 people who work with me in my firm to continue to have the same level of enthusiasm about creating the places we had been creating in fact we 're finishing a book which is called " pleasure " which is about sensual pleasure in spaces but i 've got to tell you [UNK] it became impossible to do that we were really paralyzed and i found myself the friday after september 11th [UNK] two days afterwards [UNK] literally unable to motivate anyone to do anything we gave the office a few days off and in discussing this with other architects we had seen people saying in the press that they should rebuild the towers as they were [UNK] they should rebuild them 50 stories taller and i thought it was astonishing to speculate as if this were a competition on something that was such a fresh wound and i had a series of discussions [UNK] first with rick scofidio and liz diller who collaborated with us on this and several other people [UNK] and really felt like we had to find relevance in doing something and that as people who create places the ultimate way to help was n't to pontificate or to make up scenarios but to help right now so we tried to come up with a way as a group to have a kind of design swat team and that was the mission that we came up with ka were you conscious of suddenly [UNK] as a designer whose work is all about fulfilling wants [UNK] suddenly fulfilling needs dr well what i was aware of was there was this overwhelming need to act now and we were asked to participate in a few projects before this there was a school ps 234 that had been evacuated down at ground zero they moved to an abandoned school we took about 20 or 30 architects and designers and artists and over four days [UNK] it was like this urban barn-raising [UNK] to renovate it and everyone wanted to help it was just extraordinary tom otterness contributed maira kalman contributed and it became this cathartic experience for us ka and that was done effectively by october 8 or something dr yeah ka obviously what you faced in trying to do something as substantial as this project [UNK] and this is only one of four that you 've designed to surround the site [UNK] you must have run up against the incredibly byzantine entrenched bureaucracy and powers that be in new york real estate and new york politics dr well it 's a funny thing we finished ps 234 and had dinner with a small group i was actually asked to be a committee chair on an aia committee to rebuild and i sat in on several meetings and there were the most circuitous grand plans that had to do with long-term infrastructure and rebuilding the entire city and the fact is that there were immediate wounds and needs that needed to be filled and there was talk about inclusion and wanting it to be an inclusive process and it was n't an inclusive group so we said what is [UNK] ka it was not an inclusive group dr it was not an inclusive group it was predominantly a white rich corporate group that was not representative of the city ka shocking dr yeah surprising so rick and liz and kevin and i came up with the idea the city actually approached us we first approached the city about pier 94 we saw how ps 234 worked the families [UNK] the victims of the families [UNK] were going to this pier that was incredibly dehumanizing ka on the hudson river dr yeah and the city actually [UNK] through tim zagat initially and then through christyne nicholas then we got to giuliani [UNK] said " you know we do n't want to do anything with pier 94 right now but we have an observation platform for the families down at ground zero that we 'd like to be a more dignified experience for the families and a way to protect it from the weather " so i went down there with rick and liz and kevin and i 've got to say it was the most moving experience of my life it was devastating to see the simple plywood platform with a rail around it where the families of the victims had left notes to them and there was no mediation between us and the experience there was no filter and i remembered on september 11th on 14th street the roof of our building [UNK] we can see the world trade towers prominently [UNK] and i saw the first building collapse from a conference room on the eighth floor on a tv that we had set up and then everyone was up on the roof so i ran up there and it was amazing how much harder it was to believe in real life than it was on tv there was something about the comfort of the filter and how much information was between us and the experience so seeing this in a very simple dignified way was a very powerful experience so we went back to the city and said we 're not particularly interested in the upgrade of this as a vip platform but we 've spent some time down there at the same time the city had this need they were looking for a solution to deal with 30 or 40 thousand people a day who were going down there that had nowhere to go and there was no way to deal with the traffic around the site so dealing with it is just an immediate master plan there was a way [UNK] there had to be a way [UNK] to get people to move around the site ka but then you 've got to figure out a way [UNK] we will skip over the insanely tedious process of getting permits and getting everybody on board [UNK] but simply funding this thing it looks like a fairly simple thing but this was a half a million dollar project dr well we knew that if it was n't privately funded it was n't going to happen and we also frankly knew that if it did n't happen by the end of the giuliani administration then everyone who we were dealing with at the dot and the police department and all of the [UNK] we were meeting with 20 or 30 people with the city at a time and it was set up by the office of emergency management this incredible act on their part because they really wanted this and they sensed that this needed to happen ka and there was therefore this ticking clock because giuliani was obviously out three months after that dr yeah so the first thing we had to do was find a way to get this [UNK] we had to work with the families of the victims through the city to make sure that they knew this was happening because this did n't want to be a surprise and we also had to be as under the radar screen as we could be in new york because the key was not raising a lot of objection and sort of working as quietly as possible we came up with the idea of setting up a foundation mainly because when we found a contractor who would build this he would not agree to do this even if we would pay him the money there needed to be a foundation in place so we came up with a foundation and actually what happened was one major developer in new york [UNK] ka who shall remain nameless i guess dr yeah his initials are js and he owns rockefeller center if that helps anyone [UNK] volunteered to help and we met with him the prices from the contractors were between five to 700,000 dollars and atlantic-heydt who 's the largest scaffolding contractor in the country volunteered to do it at cost so this developer said " you know what we 'll underwrite the entire expense " and we said " that 's incredible 1 " and i think this was the 21st and we knew this had to be built and up by the 28th and we had to start construction the next day we had a meeting that evening with his contractor of choice and the contractor showed up with the drawings of the platform about half the size that we had drawn it ka sort of like the spinal tap scene where you get the tiny little stonehenge i guess dr in fact it was as if this was going to be window-washing scaffolding there was no sense of the fact that this is next to saint paul [UNK] and a place to reflect and remember and i 've got to say that we spent a lot of time in putting this together watching the crowds that gathered at saint paul [UNK] which is just to the right [UNK] and moving around the site and i live down there so we spent a lot of time looking at the need and i think people were amazed at two things [UNK] i think they were amazed at the destruction but i think there was a sense of disbelief about the heroics of new yorkers that i found very moving just the sort of everyday heroics of new yorkers so we were in this meeting and the contractor literally said " i 'm going to lock the door because this developer will not agree to have you leave till you 've signed off on this " and we said " well this is half the size it does n't have any of the design features that have been agreed upon by everyone [UNK] everyone in the city we 'd have to go back to the beginning to do this " and i convinced him that we should leave the room with the agreement to build it as designed the next day i got an email from the developer saying that he was withdrawing all funding so we did n't know what to do but we decided to cast a very wide net we emailed out letters to as many people as we could [UNK] several people in the audience here [UNK] who were very helpful ka there was no thought of abandoning ship at that point dr no in fact i told the contractor to go ahead he had already ordered materials based on my go-ahead we knew that one way or another this was going to happen and we just felt it had to happen ka you were funding it yourself and with contributions and this foundation richard i think very correctly made the point at the beginning [UNK] before all the chair designers came out [UNK] about the history of chair designers imposing aesthetic solutions on this kind of universal banal common problem of sitting it seems to me with this that it was the opposite of that this was an unprecedented singular design problem dr well here 's the issue we knew that this was not in the sense of [UNK] we think about the site and think about the need for a memorial it was important that this not be categorized as a memorial that this was a place for people to reflect to remember [UNK] a kind of quiet place so it led us to using design solutions that created as few filters between the viewer [UNK] as we said about the families ' platform [UNK] and the experience as possible it 's all incredibly humble material it 's scaffolding and plywood and it allows [UNK] by sort of the procession of the movement up by saint paul 's and down the other side [UNK] it gives you about 300 feet to go up 13 feet from the ground to where you get the 360 degree view but the design was driven by a need to be quick cheap safe respectful flexible one of the other things is this is designed to be moveable because when we looked at the four platforms around the site one of which is an upgrade of the families ' platform we knew that these had to be moveable to respond to changing conditions and the changing definition of what ground zero is ka your work [UNK] i mean we 've talked about this before [UNK] a lot of your work i think is informed by your belief in or your focus on the temporariness of all things and the evanescence of things and a kind of " eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die " sort of sense of existence this is clearly not a work for the ages you know a couple of years this thing is n't going to be here did that require as an architect a new way of thinking about what you were doing to think of it as this purely temporary installation dr no i do n't think so i think this is obviously substantially different from anything we 'd ever thought about doing before just by the nature of it where it overlaps with thoughts about our work in general is number one [UNK] the notion of collaboration as a sort of way to get things done and kevin kennon rick scofidio liz diller and all the people within the city [UNK] norman lear who i spoke to four hours before our deadline for funding offered to give us a bridge loan to help us get through it so the notion of collaboration [UNK] i think this reinforces how important that is and in terms of the temporary nature of it our goal was not to create something that would be there longer than it needed to be i think what we were most interested in was promoting a kind of dialogue that we felt may not have been happening enough in this city about what 's really happening there and a day or two before it opened was giuliani 's farewell address where he proposed the idea of all of ground zero being a memorial which was very controversial but it resonated with a lot of people and i think regardless of what the position is about how this sacred piece of land is to be used having it come out of actually seeing it in a real encounter i think makes it a more powerful dialogue and that 's what we were interested in so that very much is in the realm of things i 've been interested in before ka it seems to me among other things a lovely piece of civic infrastructure it enables that conversation to get serious and six months after the fact [UNK] and only a few months away from the site being cleaned [UNK] we are very quickly now getting to the point where those conversations about what should go there are getting serious do you have [UNK] having been as physically involved in the site as you have been doing this project [UNK] have any ideas about what should or should n't be done dr well i think one thing that should n't be done is evaluate [UNK] i think right now the discussion is a very closed discussion on the master plan the protetch gallery recently had a show on ideas for buildings which had some sort of inventive ideas of buildings ka but it had some really terrible ideas dr and it also felt a little bit like a kind of competition of ideas where i think the focus of ideas should be on master planning and uses and i think there should be a broader [UNK] which there 's starting to be [UNK] the dialogue is really opening up to what does this site really want to be and i truly believe until the issue of memorial is sorted out that it 's going to be very hard to have an intelligent discussion there 's a few discussions right now that i think are very positive about depressing the west side highway and connecting this over so that there 's one uninterrupted piece of land ka well i think that 's interesting and it gets to another issue that was probably inappropriate to discuss six months ago but perhaps is n't now which is not many of us love the world trade center as a piece of architecture as what it had done to this city and that huge plaza is this an opportunity is the silver lining [UNK] a silver lining here [UNK] to rebuild some more traditional city grid or not dr i think there 's a real opportunity to engage in a discussion of why we live in cities and why do we live in places where such dissimilar people collide up against us each day i do n't think it has much to do with 50 or 60 or 70 or 80 thousand new office spaces regardless of what the number is so yeah i think there is a chance to re-look at how we think about cities and in fact there 's a proposal on the table now for building number seven ka which was the building just north of the towers dr right which the towers fell into and the reason that 's been held up is essentially by community outrage that they 're not re-opening the street to connect that back to the rest of the city i think a public dialogue [UNK] i think you know i 'd like to see an international competition and a call for ideas for uses ka whether it 's arts whether it 's housing whether it 's what amount of shopping dr right and we 're looking for other things this small foundation we put together is looking for other ways to help including taking a small piece adjacent to the site and inviting 10 architects who currently do n't have a voice in new york to do artist housing and find other ways to encourage the discussion to be against sort of monolithic single solutions and more about a multiplicity of things ka before we end i know you have a piece of digital video of the experience of being on this platform dr john kamen [UNK] who 's here actually [UNK] put together a two and a half minute piece that shows the platform in use so i thought that would be good to end with dr we 're looking from fulton street west one of the tricky issues we had with the giuliani administration was i had forgotten how anti-graffiti he was and essentially our structure was designed to be written on ka as you say it 's not a memorial but were you conscious of memorials the vietnam memorial those kinds of forms dr we certainly did as much research as we could and we were conscious of other memorials and also the complexity and length of time they really take to do it 's 350 people on the committee for oklahoma city which is why we thought of this as a sort of ad-hoc spontaneous solution that expanded on union square and the places that were ad-hoc memorials in the city already the scaffolding you can see built up over the street is de-mountable what 's interesting now is the nature of the site has totally changed so that what you 're aware of is not just the destruction of the buildings in ground zero but all of the buildings around it [UNK] and the scars on the building around it which are enormous this shows saint paul 's on the left ka i just want to thank you on behalf of new yorkers for making this happen and getting this done but the kind of virtually instantaneous nature of its erection and its being there almost before you could believe that a response of this magnitude could be accomplished is part of its extraordinary [UNK] i do n't know if beauty is the word [UNK] but presence dr it was an honor to do and we were thrilled to be able to show it here .it 's really quite an honor to be here tonight and i 'm really glad that i stayed here and listened because i 've really been inspired and i 'm going to play some songs for you tonight that are literally world premieres i 've been working on my new record and i 've never played these songs for anybody except the microphone this is a song that i wrote about the meaning of technology which goes perfectly with this gathering i started thinking about [UNK] when i was in college especially as a blind person doing a research paper was a major undertaking you had to go to the library see if you could get them to find the books for you you know footnotes and all that now you can just go on google just look it up i wish i had that when i was in college anyway this is a song about we have all this but what are we going to do with it it 's called " all the answers " what is the weather in cincinnati what is the time in tokyo who is this little child 's daddy and who the hell needs to know why do memories of you linger when i 'm trying to reach my goal and why must i move my fingers to the music in my soul i do n't know i do n't have to know 'cause here i go 1 and i got all the answers right here in my hand and i got all the answers and i do n't have to understand 'cause i got all the answers think i 'll rummage through the century while i listen to the sea oh it 's good to be so free so free who was mayor of chicago back in 1964 and why did shakespeare create iago to tear apart a love so pure how can my dreams be so vivid in a psychosonic way why must i become so livid about the news i hear today i do n't know i do n't have to know and here i go 1 'cause i got all the answers right here in my hand and i got all the answers see i do n't have to understand 'cause i got all the answers i think i 'll browse on through the tabloid news while i sip my tea mm it 's good to be so free i never ever have to be alone i can do it all right here in my home yeah mm-hmm 1 everything that 's ever been known i can punch it up right here on my phone freedom train coming soon right here in my living room from baton rouge to saskatoon and all points in between 'cause i got all the answers right here on my screen and i got all the answers yeah i got every book and magazine i got all i got all i got all 1 i got all the answers all the answers oh yeah uh-huh 1 but i tell you what i 'm going to do i 'm going to find the capitol of peru or the latitude of kathmandu i 'm gon na google it 'cause everybody 's doing it and then i 'll rummage through the century i got all i got all i got all 1 i got all the answers yeah yeah i got all the answers thank you whew 1 it 's a miracle i did n't make any mistakes on that song that 's the first time i 've ever played it it 's a " feel the fear and do it anyway " kind of thing this next song is a song that started out as a dream [UNK] a childhood dream it was one of the titles that i was sort of thinking about calling my record except there 's a couple of problems one thing is it 's unpronounceable and it 's a made-up word it 's called " tembererana " and the song is based on what i think was my first childhood attempts to think about invisible forces so " tembererana " was these dreams in which i would be running away from bad feelings [UNK] is the only way i can put it so this is called " tembererana " it 's based on an argentinian rhythm called " carnivalito " a dream within a dream a world within a world the sound of a primal scream travels out across the land images flickering the sound of the war machine a procession of limousines travels slowly across the land another child could use a hand reaching out from within tembererana hey tembererana 1 annihilation moves the earth is an open tomb the sound of the final boom rumbles fiercely across the land fear you 're the enemy obliterating all but thee you see what you want to see before i 'm blinded i will toast the shade of power that i love most the power of creation tembererana hey tembererana 1 da da da da da da da da

talkid1271talkid titleYves Rossy Fly with the Jetmantitle transcript text jetman - yves rossy grand canyon narrator many of the tests are conducted while yves is strapped onto the wing because yves ' body is an integral part of the aircraft text wind tunnel tests narrator the wing has no steering controls no flaps no rudder yves uses his body to steer the wing stefan von bergen well he turns by just putting his head on one or the other side and sometimes he assists that with his hands sometimes even with the leg he 's acting as a human fuselage so to say and that 's quite unique narrator when he arches his back he gains altitude when he pushes his shoulders forward he goes into a dive text swiss alps strait of gibraltar crossing english channel crossing commentator there he goes there is yves rossy and i think the wing is open the wing is open so our first critical moment it 's open he is down is he flying commentator two it looks like he 's stabilized he 's starting to make his climb commentator there 's that 90 degree turn you 're talking about taking him out he 's out over the channel there is yves rossy there is no turning back now he is over the english channel and underway ladies and gentlemen an historic flight has begun commentator two and what he 's going to do as he approaches the ground is pull down on those toggles to flare slow himself down just a little bit and then come in for a nice landing commentator there he is yves rossy has landed in england bruno giussani and now he 's in edinburgh yves rossy and his equipment as well yves welcome it is quite amazing those sequences were shot over the last three years in various moments of your activities and there were many many others so it 's possible to fly almost like a bird what is it [ like ] to be up there yves rossy it 's fun it 's fun i do n't have feathers but i feel like a bird sometimes it 's really an unreal feeling because normally you have a big thing a plane around you and when i strap just these little harnesses this little wing i really have the feeling of being a bird bg how did you start to become jetman yr it was about 20 years ago when i discovered free falling when you go out of an airplane you are almost naked you take a position like that and especially when you take a tracking position you have the feeling that you are flying and that 's the nearest thing to the dream you have no machine around you you are just in the element it 's very short and only in one direction so the idea was okay keep that feeling of freedom but change the vector and increase the time bg so i 'm kind of curious what 's your top speed yr it 's about 300 km per hour before looping that means about 190 miles per hour bg and what 's the weight of the equipment you 're carrying yr when i exit full of kerosene i 'm about 55 kilos i have 55 kilos on my back bg and you 're not piloting there is no handle no steering nothing it is purely your body and the wings become part of the body and vice versa yr that 's really the goal because if you put [ in ] steering then you reinvent the airplane and i wanted to keep this freedom of movement and it 's really like the kid playing the airplane i want to go down like that and up i climb i turn it 's really pure flying it 's not steering it 's flight bg what kind of training do you do you personally for that yr actually i try to stay just fit i do n't do special physical training just i try to keep my mobility through new activities for example last winter i began with kite surfing [UNK] so new things so you have to adapt because this is [UNK] i 'm quite an experienced manager of systems as a pilot but this is really [UNK] you need fluidity you need to be agile and also to adapt really fast bg somebody in the audience asked me " how does he breathe up there " because you 're going fast and you 're up 3,000 meters or so yr okay up to 3,000 meters it 's not such a big problem with oxygen but for example bikers they have the same speed just with the helmet integral helmet it 's really no problem to breathe bg describe for me the equipment since you have it here so breitling 's four engines yr yeah two-meter span ultrastable profile four little engines 22 kilos thrust each turbines working with kerosene harness parachute my only instruments are [ an ] altimeter and time i know i have about eight minutes fuel so just check before it 's finished and yeah that 's all two parachutes that means if i have a problem with the first one i pull i still have the possibility to open the second one and this is my life that 's the real important thing about safety i did use that during these last 15 years about 20 times [UNK] never with that type of wing but at the beginning i can release my wing when i am in a spin or unstable bg we saw the 2009 crossing of the gibraltar strait where you lost control and then you dived down into the clouds and in the ocean so that was one of those cases where you let the wings go right yr yeah i did try in [ the ] clouds but you lose [ orientation completely ] so i did try to take again a climb altitude i thought okay i will go out but most probably i did something like that bg something that is not very safe in image yr but you feel great but you have not the right altitude so the next thing i saw was just blue it was the sea i have also an audible altimeter so i was at my minimum altitude in that vector [UNK] fast [UNK] so i pulled that and then i did open my chute bg so the wings have their own parachute and you have your two parachutes yr exactly there is a rescue parachute for the wing for two reasons so i can repair it afterward and especially so nobody takes that just on his head bg i see maybe come back here this is risky stuff indeed people have died trying to do this kind of thing and you do n't look like a crazy guy you 're a swiss airline pilot so you 're rather a checklist kind of guy i assume you have standards yr yeah i have no checklist for that bg let 's not tell you employer yr no that 's really two worlds civil aviation is something that we know very well we have a hundred years of experience and you can adapt really precisely with that i have to adapt to something new that means improvise so it 's really a play between these two approaches something that i know very well [UNK] these principles for example we have two engines on an airbus with only one engine you can fly it so plan b always a plan b in a fighter you have an ejection seat that 's my ejection seat so i have the approach of a professional pilot with the respect of a pioneer in front of mother nature bg it 's well said it 's well said what happens if one of the engines stops yr i do a roll and then i stabilize and according to my altitude i continue on two or three engines it 's sometimes possible [UNK] it 's quite complicated to explain [UNK] but according to which regime i was i can continue on two and try to get a nice place to land and then i open my parachute bg so the beginning of the flight is actually you jump off a plane or a helicopter and you go on a dive and accelerate the engines and then you basically take off mid-air somewhere and then the landing as we have seen arriving on this side of the channel is through a parachute so just as a curiosity where did you land when you flew over the grand canyon did you land on the rim down at the bottom yr it was down on the bottom and i came back afterward on the sled of the helicopter back but it was too stoney and full of cactus on top bg that 's exactly why i asked the question yr and also the currents are quite funny there there is big thermal activity big difference in altitude also so it was much safer for me to land at the bottom bg so i think that right now many people in the audience are asking " okay when are you developing a double-seater so they can fly with you " yr i have a standard answer have you ever seen tandem birds bg perfect answer yves one last question what 's next for you what 's next for jetman yr first to instruct a younger guy i want to share it to do formation flights and i plan to start from a cliff like catapulted from a cliff bg so instead of jumping off a plane yes yr yes with the final goal to take off but with initial speed really i go step by step it seems a little bit crazy but it 's not it 's possible to start already now it 's just too dangerous thanks to the increasing technology better technology it will be safe and i hope it will be for everybody bg yves thank you very much yves rossy .i grew up in europe and world war ii caught me when i was between seven and 10 years old and i realized how few of the grown-ups that i knew were able to withstand the tragedies that the war visited on them [UNK] how few of them could even resemble a normal contented satisfied happy life once their job their home their security was destroyed by the war so i became interested in understanding what contributed to a life that was worth living and i tried as a child as a teenager to read philosophy and to get involved in art and religion and many other ways that i could see as a possible answer to that question and finally i ended up encountering psychology by chance i was at a ski resort in switzerland without any money to actually enjoy myself because the snow had melted and i did n't have money to go to a movie but i found that on the [UNK] i read in the newspapers that there was to be a presentation by someone in a place that i 'd seen in the center of zurich and it was about flying saucers [ that ] he was going to talk and i thought well since i ca n't go to the movies at least i will go for free to listen to flying saucers and the man who talked at that evening lecture was very interesting instead of talking about little green men he talked about how the psyche of the europeans had been traumatized by the war and now they 're projecting flying saucers into the sky he talked about how the mandalas of ancient hindu religion were kind of projected into the sky as an attempt to regain some sense of order after the chaos of war and this seemed very interesting to me and i started reading his books after that lecture and that was carl jung whose name or work i had no idea about then i came to this country to study psychology and i started trying to understand the roots of happiness this is a typical result that many people have presented and there are many variations on it but this for instance shows that about 30 percent of the people surveyed in the united states since 1956 say that their life is very happy and that has n't changed at all whereas the personal income on a scale that has been held constant to accommodate for inflation has more than doubled almost tripled in that period but you find essentially the same results namely that after a certain basic point [UNK] which corresponds more or less to just a few 1,000 dollars above the minimum poverty level [UNK] increases in material well-being do n't seem to affect how happy people are in fact you can find that the lack of basic resources material resources contributes to unhappiness but the increase in material resources does not increase happiness so my research has been focused more on [UNK] after finding out these things that actually corresponded to my own experience i tried to understand where [UNK] in everyday life in our normal experience [UNK] do we feel really happy and to start those studies about 40 years ago i began to look at creative people [UNK] first artists and scientists and so forth [UNK] trying to understand what made them feel that it was worth essentially spending their life doing things for which many of them did n't expect either fame or fortune but which made their life meaningful and worth doing this was one of the leading composers of american music back in the '70s and the interview was 40 pages long but this little excerpt is a very good summary of what he was saying during the interview and it describes how he feels when composing is going well and he says by describing it as an ecstatic state now " ecstasy " in greek meant simply to stand to the side of something and then it became essentially an analogy for a mental state where you feel that you are not doing your ordinary everyday routines so ecstasy is essentially a stepping into an alternative reality and it 's interesting if you think about it how when we think about the civilizations that we look up to as having been pinnacles of human achievement [UNK] whether it 's china greece the hindu civilization or the mayas or egyptians [UNK] what we know about them is really about their ecstasies not about their everyday life we know the temples they built where people could come to experience a different reality we know about the circuses the arenas the theaters these are the remains of civilizations and they are the places that people went to experience life in a more concentrated more ordered form now this man does n't need to go to a place like this which is also [UNK] this place this arena which is built like a greek amphitheatre is a place for ecstasy also we are participating in a reality that is different from that of the everyday life that we 're used to but this man does n't need to go there he needs just a piece of paper where he can put down little marks and as he does that he can imagine sounds that had not existed before in that particular combination so once he gets to that point of beginning to create like jennifer did in her improvisation a new reality [UNK] that is a moment of ecstasy [UNK] he enters that different reality now he says also that this is so intense an experience that it feels almost as if he did n't exist and that sounds like a kind of a romantic exaggeration but actually our nervous system is incapable of processing more than about 110 bits of information per second and in order to hear me and understand what i 'm saying you need to process about 60 bits per second that 's why you ca n't hear more than two people you ca n't understand more than two people talking to you well when you are really involved in this completely engaging process of creating something new as this man is he does n't have enough attention left over to monitor how his body feels or his problems at home he ca n't feel even that he 's hungry or tired his body disappears his identity disappears from his consciousness because he does n't have enough attention like none of us do to really do well something that requires a lot of concentration and at the same time to feel that he exists so existence is temporarily suspended and he says that his hand seems to be moving by itself now i could look at my hand for two weeks and i would n't feel any awe or wonder because i ca n't compose so what it 's telling you here is that obviously this automatic spontaneous process that he 's describing can only happen to someone who is very well trained and who has developed technique and it has become a kind of a truism in the study of creativity that you ca n't be creating anything with less than 10 years of technical-knowledge immersion in a particular field whether it 's mathematics or music it takes that long to be able to begin to change something in a way that it 's better than what was there before now when that happens he says the music just flows out and because all of these people i started interviewing [UNK] this was an interview which is over 30 years old [UNK] so many of the people described this as a spontaneous flow that i called this type of experience the " flow experience " and it happens in different realms for instance a poet describes it in this form this is by a student of mine who interviewed some of the leading writers and poets in the united states and it describes the same effortless spontaneous feeling that you get when you enter into this ecstatic state this poet describes it as opening a door that floats in the sky [UNK] a very similar description to what albert einstein gave as to how he imagined the forces of relativity when he was struggling with trying to understand how it worked but it happens in other activities for instance this is another student of mine susan jackson from australia who did work with some of the leading athletes in the world and you see here in this description of an olympic skater the same essential description of the phenomenology of the inner state of the person you do n't think it goes automatically if you merge yourself with the music and so forth it happens also actually in the most recent book i wrote called " good business " where i interviewed some of the ceos who had been nominated by their peers as being both very successful and very ethical very socially responsible you see that these people define success as something that helps others and at the same time makes you feel happy as you are working at it and like all of these successful and responsible ceos say you ca n't have just one of these things be successful if you want a meaningful and successful job anita roddick is another one of these ceos we interviewed she is the founder of body shop the natural cosmetics king it 's kind of a passion that comes from doing the best and having flow while you 're working this is an interesting little quote from masaru ibuka who was at that time starting out sony without any money without a product [UNK] they did n't have a product they did n't have anything but they had an idea and the idea he had was to establish a place of work where engineers can feel the joy of technological innovation be aware of their mission to society and work to their heart 's content i could n't improve on this as a good example of how flow enters the workplace now when we do studies [UNK] we have with other colleagues around the world done over 8,000 interviews of people [UNK] from dominican monks to blind nuns to himalayan climbers to navajo shepherds [UNK] who enjoy their work and regardless of the culture regardless of education or whatever there are these seven conditions that seem to be there when a person is in flow there 's this focus that once it becomes intense leads to a sense of ecstasy a sense of clarity you know exactly what you want to do from one moment to the other you get immediate feedback you know that what you need to do is possible to do even though difficult and sense of time disappears you forget yourself you feel part of something larger and once the conditions are present what you are doing becomes worth doing for its own sake in our studies we represent the everyday life of people in this simple scheme and we can measure this very precisely actually because we give people electronic pagers that go off 10 times a day and whenever they go off you say what you 're doing how you feel where you are what you 're thinking about and two things that we measure is the amount of challenge people experience at that moment and the amount of skill that they feel they have at that moment so for each person we can establish an average which is the center of the diagram that would be your mean level of challenge and skill which will be different from that of anybody else but you have a kind of a set point there which would be in the middle if we know what that set point is we can predict fairly accurately when you will be in flow and it will be when your challenges are higher than average and skills are higher than average and you may be doing things very differently from other people but for everyone that flow channel that area there will be when you are doing what you really like to do [UNK] play the piano be with your best friend perhaps work if work is what provides flow for you and then the other areas become less and less positive arousal is still good because you are over-challenged there your skills are not quite as high as they should be but you can move into flow fairly easily by just developing a little more skill so arousal is the area where most people learn from because that 's where they 're pushed beyond their comfort zone and to enter that [UNK] going back to flow [UNK] then they develop higher skills control is also a good place to be because there you feel comfortable but not very excited it 's not very challenging any more and if you want to enter flow from control you have to increase the challenges so those two are ideal and complementary areas from which flow is easy to go into the other combinations of challenge and skill become progressively less optimal relaxation is fine [UNK] you still feel ok boredom begins to be very aversive and apathy becomes very negative you do n't feel that you 're doing anything you do n't use your skills there 's no challenge unfortunately a lot of people 's experience is in apathy the largest single contributor to that experience is watching television the next one is being in the bathroom sitting even though sometimes watching television about seven to eight percent of the time is in flow but that 's when you choose a program you really want to watch and you get feedback from it so the question we are trying to address [UNK] and i 'm way over time [UNK] is how to put more and more of everyday life in that flow channel and that is the kind of challenge that we 're trying to understand and some of you obviously know how to do that spontaneously without any advice but unfortunately a lot of people do n't and that 's what our mandate is in a way to do thank you .i am going to be talking about secrets obviously the best way to divulge a secret is to tell someone to not say anything about it secrets i 'm using powerpoint this year just because you know i 'm into the ted thing and when you use these things you do n't have to go like that you just press it oh man um yes yes i 'm sure 1 just change it 1 is bill gates here change it 1 come on 1 what ah 1 okay that 's not my slides but it 's okay as you can see these are all maps and maps are important devices for transferring information especially if you have human cognitive ability we can see that all formulas are really maps now as humans we make maps of places that we seldom even go which seems a little wasteful of time this of course is a map of the moon there 're some very delightful names tranquilacalitis [ unclear ] my favorite is frigoris what are these people thinking frigoris what the frigoris you doing names are important frigoris this is the moon people could live there one day i 'll meet you at frigoris no i do n't think so there we see mars again with various names and this is all done by the way by the international astronomical union this is an actual group of people that sit around naming planetary objects this is from their actual book these are some of the names that they have chosen ladies and gentlemen i 'll go through a little of them bolotnitsa that of course is the slavic swamp mermaid now i think the whole concept of a mermaid does n't really blend into the swamp feel " oh look 1 mermaid come out of swamp oh boy 1 it 's time for bolotnitsa 1 " djabran fluctus if that do n't flow off the tongue what does i mean kids are studying this stuff and they 've got the word " fluctus " up there that 's wrong one dyslexic kid and he could be ruining his life " it fluctus up mama " hikuleo fluctus that 's a little more flowing hikuleo sounds like a kind of a leonardo dicaprio 17 syllable thing and that 's the tonga underworld and one of my favorites is the itoki fluctus who is the nicaraguan goddess of insects stars and planets now if you 're a goddess of stars and planets would n't you relegate insects to somebody else " no no really i 'm so busy with the stars would you mind taking the insects thank you darling oh take the spiders too i know they 're not insects but i do n't care monkeys chimps just get rid of the hairy creatures " now we 're going to be going to mars one day and when we do it 's going to be unfair for the people that are living there to have to live with these ridiculous names so you 'll be on mars and you 're at hellespointica depressio which has got to be a really " up " place yeah i 'm at the depressio and i want to get over to amazonis so i plug it into the mars map and click the button and there 's my directions i go to chrysokeras left to the thymiamata then to niliacus lacus which is not a bad name niliacus lacus try to get the practice slick-a-tick-a-bacus that 's a cool name i will say that so i hold back a little of my venom for these astronomical misnomers and then of course arnon to thoth and of course there will be advertisements this is from their rule book the international astronomical union and you know they 're international because they put it " en francais " as well l'union astronomique internationale for those of you who do n't speak french i thought i 'd translate for you from the rulebook nomenclature is a tool the first consideration make it clear simple and unambiguous and i think that djabran fluctus that fits that mode that 's simple the goddess of goats very simple djabran fluctus " now frank is this clear to you djabran fluctus " " yeah that 's the goat goddess right the abacazanian it 's clear to me " " listen i 'm going back to the swamp mermaid can you call me in a little while " also from the actual document i highlighted a part i thought may be of interest anyone can suggest changing a name so i look to you fellow member of the earth community we 've got to change this stuff up fast so these are actual names of people that work there i did some more investigation these are more people working for this group and as you can see they do n't use their first names these are people naming planets and they wo n't use their first names something is askew here is it because his name is really jupiter blunck is that ganymede andromeda burba is that mars ya marov i do n't know but it 's investigative material no doubt there are some mapping people who do use their names witness please eugene shoemaker who diligently from a young boy decided he wanted to make maps of celestial bodies must have been a very interesting day in the shoemaker house " mom i want to make maps " " that 's wonderful eugene you could make maps of toronto " " no i want to make maps of planets " " yeah go to your room " martians venusians jovians we have names for places where people do n't exist that seems a little silly to me there are no jovians getting back to my premise i used stamps by the way because you do n't have to pay anybody for the rights there is obviously einstein niels bohr de fermat 's last theorem and i 'm not sure whether that 's james coburn or richard harris it 's definitely one of the two i 'm not really clear which one but obviously the point is that numbers are maps and within numbers is there an underlying secret to the universe that is the premise of this particular presentation by the way that 's a natural picture of saturn no adjustments i mean that 's just beautiful so beautiful that i will even give up a laugh to explain my love of this particular planet and the day saturday named after it wonderfully so formulas relate number to form that 's euler his formula was one of the inspirations that lead to the beginning of string theory which is kind of cool not that funny but it is cool he was also famous for having no body which a lot of you are like " how did he figure that out " he 's got no body no man just a head floating high here comes euler and that 's an icosahedron which is one of the five sacred solids very important shapes you see the icosahedron again the dodecahedron it 's dual there is a dodecahedron which i had to do in my room last night the five sacred solids as you can see there which is not to be confused with the five sacred salads blue cheese ranch oil and vinegar thousand islands and house i suggest the house the reality now here is something important what 's important about this is these shapes are duals of each other and you can see how the icosahedron withdraws into the dodecahedron and then they just merge into each other so the whole concept of branes in the universe if the universe is shaped like a dodecahedron this is a very good map of what could possibly be and that is of course what we are here to talk about what a coincidence 1 october 9th in france jean-pierre luminet said that the universe is probably shaped like a dodecahedron based on information that they got from this probe this would be a normal wave pattern but what they 're seeing way out there in the far reaches of the microwave background is this kind of odd undulation it does n't plug in to what they suspected a flat universe would be so you can kind of get an idea from this extrapolating that back under this huge picture so we get this idea of what the primal universe looked like and judging from this it looks a little like a cheeseburger so i 'm thinking the universe is either a dodecahedron or a cheeseburger and for me that 's a win-win everybody goes i 'm happy better really hurry up i just threw this in because as important as all of our intellectual abilities are without heart and without love it 's just [UNK] it 's all meaningless and that to me is really beautiful except for that creepy guy in the background getting back to the point of my particular presentation kepler one of my great heroes who realized that these five solids which i spoke of earlier were related somehow to the planets but he could n't prove it it freaked him out but it did lead to newton discovering gravity so maps of things leading to organized understandings of the universe in which we emerge now this is isaac from a vietnamese stamp i am not suggesting at all that my vietnamese brothers and sisters could maybe use a little art class here and there but 1 that 's not a good picture not a good picture now my friends in the island of nevis are a little better look at that 1 that 's isaac newton that guy is rockin ' what a handsome cat once again nicaragua let me down and copernicus looks like johnny carson which is really weird i do n't get that at all once again these guys rock it out isaac is kickin ' ass man he looks like a rock star this is freaky is a major way this is sierra leone they got little babies in there floating in there man i do n't really need to comment on this but i did n't know that isaac newton was in the moody blues did you when did this happen it 's a different kind of course and they 've got five apples i mean these guys are extrapolating in realms that are not necessarily valid although five is a good number of course ecuador my friend kepler as you can see they call him juan juan no 1 johannes not juan it was n't carlos chaplain it 's wrong rené descartes of course once again these grenada people this is like way too sick for anybody 's imagination he 's all murky there is little kids leaning on his leg little ghosts flying around we got ta clean this stuff up fast ladies and gentlemen this is of course the cartesian coordinates once again that 's sierra leone this is again indicating how numbers relate to space relate to form maps of the universe because that 's why we 're here really i think to figure stuff out and to love each other descartes before the horse now monaco took descartes and just flipped him around now monaco is problematic for me and i 'll show you why here is a map all they have is a casino on it and why franklin delano roosevelt is on their map i do n't even want to hazard a guess but i 'd say he 'd been to hellespointica depressio recently this is the flag of monaco ladies and gentlemen the flag of indonesia please examine not sure how this came to be but it 's not right in monaco " no what are you talking about they are so different look ours is more red it 's longer they stole our flag 1 they stole our flag 1 " bode 's law was n't even his law it was a guy named titus and the reason i just bring this up because it is a law that does n't really work that 's jude law and some of his films recently did n't work just a correlation that indicates how things are misinterpreted and i wonder if the photographer said " okay jude could you touch your tooth that 's good " just a tip if you 're being photographed for press pictures do n't touch your teeth prime numbers gauss one of my favorites golden section i 've been obsessed with this thing since before i was born i know that scares a lot of you but that was my purpose entirely there we can see fibonacci numbers related to the golden section because fibonacci and golden section relate to the unfolding of the measured meter of matter as i refer to it if fibonacci had been on paxil that would be the fibonacci series " ten milligram 20 milligram " " leonardo dinner 's ready put down those books and take your pills " " yes mama " alright where is this going that 's a good question here is the premise that i began 27 years ago if numbers can express the laws of this incredible universe that we live i reason through some sort of reverse engineering we could extrapolate from them some basic structural element of this universe and that 's what i did twenty-seven years ago i started working on this and i tried to build a particle accelerator and that did n't work out well so then i thought a calculator is a metaphor i can just divide numbers that 's like atom smashing that 's what i did that 's how i found moleeds moleeds are what i believe the thing that will allow string theory to be proved they are the nodes on the string patterns and relationships 27 37 that was the first chart i came up with you can see even if you do n't go for the numbers the beauty of the symmetry the numbers from one to 36 divided into six groups symmetry pairs every top adds up to 37 bottom all 74 there is so many intricate relationships that i 'm not going to go there now because you would say " hey go back to the fluctus part " circle of fifths acoustic harmony geometric symmetry i knew those two were related once again the cartesian kind of cross-over so i said if i 'm going to put a circle see what kind of patterns i get boom the red system look at that you ca n't just make this stuff up ladies and gentlemen you ca n't just go around going " oh i 'm going to put some triangles in a circle and they 're going to be symmetrical and they 're all going to add up and it 's going to be oh yeah i figured that out " this is beyond anything anybody could just make up there is the orange system and you 'll see over here these are multiples of the number 27 and they recapitulate that shape even though that 's a circle of nine and that 's a circle of 36 it 's nuts that 's the green system it all folds in half on the green system right between 18 and 19 the blue system the violet it 's all there look at that 1 i mean you can not make that stuff up that just does n't fall out of a tree ladies and gentlemen twenty-seven years of my life 1 and i 'm presenting it here at ted why because this is the place if aliens land i hope they come here " we are going to destroy the earth hmmm 1 maybe not " in this last year i have found these subsequent systems which allow for the mathematic possibilities of the calabi-yau manifolds in a way that does n't necessitate these little hidden dimensions which works mathematically but it just does n't seem god-like to me it just seems like it 's not sexy and elegant it 's hidden i do n't want hidden i want to see it i found other pairs all have symmetry even though unlike the master one their symmetry is split unbelievable this is like crazy am i the only one that sees this you know i did n't just draw this in a day by the way you know try making some charts like this at home you got ta be accurate 1 there 's measurement involved increments these are maps by the way not stamps but one day okay i 'm getting to the punch golden ratio it 's crazy and look at this built within it is the golden ratio i start looking at that and look at them again they start looking like planets i go to jpl i look at the orbits of the planets i find 18 examples of it in our solar system i never told anybody this is the first thing this could be history kepler was right eighteen and 19 the middle of the moleeds 0.618 is the golden section multiply them together 18.618 x 19.618 is 365.247 which is .005 different from the number of days in a year hey you ca n't make this up thank you very much thank you thank you .today i 'm going to talk to you about the problem of other minds and the problem i 'm going to talk about is not the familiar one from philosophy which is " how can we know whether other people have minds " that is maybe you have a mind and everyone else is just a really convincing robot so that 's a problem in philosophy but for today 's purposes i 'm going to assume that many people in this audience have a mind and that i do n't have to worry about this there is a second problem that is maybe even more familiar to us as parents and teachers and spouses and novelists which is " why is it so hard to know what somebody else wants or believes " or perhaps more relevantly " why is it so hard to change what somebody else wants or believes " i think novelists put this best like philip roth who said " and yet what are we to do about this terribly significant business of other people so ill equipped are we all to envision one another 's interior workings and invisible aims " so as a teacher and as a spouse this is of course a problem i confront every day but as a scientist i 'm interested in a different problem of other minds and that is the one i 'm going to introduce to you today and that problem is " how is it so easy to know other minds " so to start with an illustration you need almost no information one snapshot of a stranger to guess what this woman is thinking or what this man is and put another way the crux of the problem is the machine that we use for thinking about other minds our brain is made up of pieces brain cells that we share with all other animals with monkeys and mice and even sea slugs and yet you put them together in a particular network and what you get is the capacity to write romeo and juliet or to say as alan greenspan did " i know you think you understand what you thought i said but i 'm not sure you realize that what you heard is not what i meant " so the job of my field of cognitive neuroscience is to stand with these ideas one in each hand and to try to understand how you can put together simple units simple messages over space and time in a network and get this amazing human capacity to think about minds so i 'm going to tell you three things about this today obviously the whole project here is huge and i 'm going to tell you just our first few steps about the discovery of a special brain region for thinking about other people 's thoughts some observations on the slow development of this system as we learn how to do this difficult job and then finally to show that some of the differences between people in how we judge others can be explained by differences in this brain system so first the first thing i want to tell you is that there is a brain region in the human brain in your brains whose job it is to think about other people 's thoughts this is a picture of it it 's called the right temporo-parietal junction it 's above and behind your right ear and this is the brain region you used when you saw the pictures i showed you or when you read romeo and juliet or when you tried to understand alan greenspan and you do n't use it for solving any other kinds of logical problems so this brain region is called the right tpj and this picture shows the average activation in a group of what we call typical human adults they 're mit undergraduates the second thing i want to say about this brain system is that although we human adults are really good at understanding other minds we were n't always that way it takes children a long time to break into the system i 'm going to show you a little bit of that long extended process the first thing i 'm going to show you is a change between age three and five as kids learn to understand that somebody else can have beliefs that are different from their own so i 'm going to show you a five-year-old who is getting a standard kind of puzzle that we call the false belief task rebecca saxe this is the first pirate his name is ivan and you know what pirates really like child what rs pirates really like cheese sandwiches child cheese i love cheese 1 rs yeah so ivan has this cheese sandwich and he says " yum yum yum yum yum 1 i really love cheese sandwiches " and ivan puts his sandwich over here on top of the pirate chest and ivan says " you know what i need a drink with my lunch " and so ivan goes to get a drink and while ivan is away the wind comes and it blows the sandwich down onto the grass and now here comes the other pirate this pirate is called joshua and joshua also really loves cheese sandwiches so joshua has a cheese sandwich and he says " yum yum yum yum yum 1 i love cheese sandwiches " and he puts his cheese sandwich over here on top of the pirate chest child so that one is his rs that one is joshua 's that 's right child and then his went on the ground rs that 's exactly right child so he wo n't know which one is his rs oh so now joshua goes off to get a drink ivan comes back and he says " i want my cheese sandwich " so which one do you think ivan is going to take child i think he is going to take that one rs yeah you think he 's going to take that one all right let 's see oh yeah you were right he took that one so that 's a five-year-old who clearly understands that other people can have false beliefs and what the consequences are for their actions now i 'm going to show you a three-year-old who got the same puzzle rs and ivan says " i want my cheese sandwich " which sandwich is he going to take do you think he 's going to take that one let 's see what happens let 's see what he does here comes ivan and he says " i want my cheese sandwich " and he takes this one uh-oh why did he take that one child his was on the grass so the three-year-old does two things differently first he predicts ivan will take the sandwich that 's really his and second when he sees ivan taking the sandwich where he left his where we would say he 's taking that one because he thinks it 's his the three-year-old comes up with another explanation he 's not taking his own sandwich because he does n't want it because now it 's dirty on the ground so that 's why he 's taking the other sandwich now of course development does n't end at five and we can see the continuation of this process of learning to think about other people 's thoughts by upping the ante and asking children now not for an action prediction but for a moral judgment so first i 'm going to show you the three-year-old again rs so is ivan being mean and naughty for taking joshua 's sandwich child yeah rs should ivan get in trouble for taking joshua 's sandwich child yeah so it 's maybe not surprising he thinks it was mean of ivan to take joshua 's sandwich since he thinks ivan only took joshua 's sandwich to avoid having to eat his own dirty sandwich but now i 'm going to show you the five-year-old remember the five-year-old completely understood why ivan took joshua 's sandwich rs was ivan being mean and naughty for taking joshua 's sandwich child um yeah and so it is not until age seven that we get what looks more like an adult response rs should ivan get in trouble for taking joshua 's sandwich child no because the wind should get in trouble he says the wind should get in trouble for switching the sandwiches and now what we 've started to do in my lab is to put children into the brain scanner and ask what 's going on in their brain as they develop this ability to think about other people 's thoughts so the first thing is that in children we see this same brain region the right tpj being used while children are thinking about other people but it 's not quite like the adult brain so whereas in the adults as i told you this brain region is almost completely specialized [UNK] it does almost nothing else except for thinking about other people 's thoughts [UNK] in children it 's much less so when they are age five to eight the age range of the children i just showed you and actually if we even look at eight to 11-year-olds getting into early adolescence they still do n't have quite an adult-like brain region and so what we can see is that over the course of childhood and even into adolescence both the cognitive system our mind 's ability to think about other minds and the brain system that supports it are continuing slowly to develop but of course as you 're probably aware even in adulthood people differ from one another in how good they are at thinking of other minds how often they do it and how accurately and so what we wanted to know was could differences among adults in how they think about other people 's thoughts be explained in terms of differences in this brain region so the first thing that we did is we gave adults a version of the pirate problem that we gave to the kids and i 'm going to give that to you now so grace and her friend are on a tour of a chemical factory and they take a break for coffee and grace 's friend asks for some sugar in her coffee grace goes to make the coffee and finds by the coffee a pot containing a white powder which is sugar but the powder is labeled " deadly poison " so grace thinks that the powder is a deadly poison and she puts it in her friend 's coffee and her friend drinks the coffee and is fine how many people think it was morally permissible for grace to put the powder in the coffee okay good so we ask people how much should grace be blamed in this case which we call a failed attempt to harm and we can compare that to another case where everything in the real world is the same the powder is still sugar but what 's different is what grace thinks now she thinks the powder is sugar and perhaps unsurprisingly if grace thinks the powder is sugar and puts it in her friend 's coffee people say she deserves no blame at all whereas if she thinks the powder was poison even though it 's really sugar now people say she deserves a lot of blame even though what happened in the real world was exactly the same and in fact they say she deserves more blame in this case the failed attempt to harm than in another case which we call an accident where grace thought the powder was sugar because it was labeled " sugar " and by the coffee machine but actually the powder was poison so even though when the powder was poison the friend drank the coffee and died people say grace deserves less blame in that case when she innocently thought it was sugar than in the other case where she thought it was poison and no harm occurred people though disagree a little bit about exactly how much blame grace should get in the accident case some people think she should deserve more blame and other people less and what i 'm going to show you is what happened when we look inside the brains of people while they 're making that judgment so what i 'm showing you from left to right is how much activity there was in this brain region and from top to bottom how much blame people said that grace deserved and what you can see is on the left when there was very little activity in this brain region people paid little attention to her innocent belief and said she deserved a lot of blame for the accident whereas on the right where there was a lot of activity people paid a lot more attention to her innocent belief and said she deserved a lot less blame for causing the accident so that 's good but of course what we 'd rather is have a way to interfere with function in this brain region and see if we could change people 's moral judgment and we do have such a tool it 's called trans-cranial magnetic stimulation or tms this is a tool that lets us pass a magnetic pulse through somebody 's skull into a small region of their brain and temporarily disorganize the function of the neurons in that region so i 'm going to show you a demo of this first i 'm going to show you that this is a magnetic pulse i 'm going to show you what happens when you put a quarter on the machine when you hear clicks we 're turning the machine on so now i 'm going to apply that same pulse to my brain to the part of my brain that controls my hand so there is no physical force just a magnetic pulse woman ready rebecca rs yes okay so it causes a small involuntary contraction in my hand by putting a magnetic pulse in my brain and we can use that same pulse now applied to the rtpj to ask if we can change people 's moral judgments so these are the judgments i showed you before people 's normal moral judgments and then we can apply tms to the rtpj and ask how people 's judgments change and the first thing is people can still do this task overall so their judgments of the case when everything was fine remain the same they say she deserves no blame but in the case of a failed attempt to harm where grace thought that it was poison although it was really sugar people now say it was more okay she deserves less blame for putting the powder in the coffee and in the case of the accident where she thought that it was sugar but it was really poison and so she caused a death people say that it was less okay she deserves more blame so what i 've told you today is that people come actually especially well equipped to think about other people 's thoughts we have a special brain system that lets us think about what other people are thinking this system takes a long time to develop slowly throughout the course of childhood and into early adolescence and even in adulthood differences in this brain region can explain differences among adults in how we think about and judge other people but i want to give the last word back to the novelists and to philip roth who ended by saying " the fact remains that getting people right is not what living is all about anyway it 's getting them wrong that is living getting them wrong and wrong and wrong and then on careful reconsideration getting them wrong again " thank you chris anderson so i have a question when you start talking about using magnetic pulses to change people 's moral judgments that sounds alarming please tell me that you 're not taking phone calls from the pentagon say rs i 'm not i mean they 're calling but i 'm not taking the call ca they really are calling so then seriously you must lie awake at night sometimes wondering where this work leads i mean you 're clearly an incredible human being but someone could take this knowledge and in some future not-torture chamber do acts that people here might be worried about rs yeah we worry about this so there 's a couple of things to say about tms one is that you ca n't be tmsed without knowing it so it 's not a surreptitious technology it 's quite hard actually to get those very small changes the changes i showed you are impressive to me because of what they tell us about the function of the brain but they 're small on the scale of the moral judgments that we actually make and what we changed was not people 's moral judgments when they 're deciding what to do when they 're making action choices we changed their ability to judge other people 's actions and so i think of what i 'm doing not so much as studying the defendant in a criminal trial but studying the jury ca is your work going to lead to any recommendations in education to perhaps bring up a generation of kids able to make fairer moral judgments rs that 's one of the idealistic hopes the whole research program here of studying the distinctive parts of the human brain is brand new until recently what we knew about the brain were the things that any other animal 's brain could do too so we could study it in animal models we knew how brains see and how they control the body and how they hear and sense and the whole project of understanding how brains do the uniquely human things [UNK] learn language and abstract concepts and thinking about other people 's thoughts [UNK] that 's brand new and we do n't know yet what the implications will be of understanding it ca so i 've got one last question there is this thing called the hard problem of consciousness that puzzles a lot of people the notion that you can understand why a brain works perhaps but why does anyone have to feel anything why does it seem to require these beings who sense things for us to operate you 're a brilliant young neuroscientist i mean what chances do you think there are that at some time in your career someone you or someone else is going to come up with some paradigm shift in understanding what seems an impossible problem rs i hope they do and i think they probably wo n't ca why rs it 's not called the hard problem of consciousness for nothing ca that 's a great answer rebecca saxe thank you very much that was fantastic .i 'm going to tell you about one of the world 's largest problems and how it can be solved i 'd like to start with a little experiment could you put your hand up if you wear glasses or contact lenses or you 've had laser refractive surgery now unfortunately there are too many of you for me to do the statistics properly but it looks like [UNK] i 'm guessing [UNK] that it 'll be about 60 percent of the room because that 's roughly the fraction of developed world population that have some sort of vision correction the world health organization estimates [UNK] well they make various estimates of the number of people who need glasses [UNK] the lowest estimate is 150 million people they also have an estimate of around a billion but in fact i would argue that we 've just done an experiment here and now which shows us that the global need for corrective eyewear is around half of any population and the problem of poor vision is actually not just a health problem it 's also an educational problem and it 's an economic problem and it 's a quality of life problem glasses are not very expensive they 're quite plentiful the problem is there are n't enough eye care professionals in the world to use the model of the delivery of corrective eyewear that we have in the developed world there are just way too few eye care professionals so this little slide here shows you an optometrist and the little blue person represents about 10,000 people and that 's the ratio in the u.k this is the ratio of optometrists to people in sub-saharan africa in fact there are some countries in sub-saharan africa where there 's one optometrist for eight million of the population how do you do this how do you solve this problem i came up with a solution to this problem and i came up with a solution based on adaptive optics for this and the idea is you make eye glasses and you adjust them yourself and that solves the problem what i want to do is to show you that one can make a pair of glasses i shall just show you how you make a pair of glasses i shall pop this in my pocket i 'm short sighted i look at the signs at the end i can hardly see them so [UNK] okay i can now see that man running out there and i can see that guy running out there i 've now made prescription eyewear to my prescription next step in my process so i 've now made eye glasses to my prescription okay so i 've made these glasses and 1 okay i 've made the glasses to my prescription and 1 1 i 've just 1 and i 've now made some glasses that 's it now these are n't the only pair in the world in fact this technology 's been evolving i started working on it in 1985 and it 's been evolving very slowly there are about 30,000 in use now and they 're in fifteen countries they 're spread around the world and i have a vision which i 'll share with you i have a global vision for vision and that vision is to try to get a billion people wearing the glasses they need by the year 2020 to do that [UNK] this is an early example of the technology the technology is being further developed [UNK] the cost has to be brought down this pair in fact these currently cost about 19 dollars but the cost has to be brought right down it has to be brought down because we 're trying to serve populations who live on a dollar a day how do you solve this problem you start to get into detail and on this slide i 'm basically explaining all the problems you have how do you distribute how do you work out how to fit the thing how do you have people realizing that they have a vision problem how do you deal with the industry and the answer to that is research what we 've done is to set up the center for vision in the developing world here in the university if you want to know more just come have a look at our website thank you .so anyway who am i i usually say to people when they say " what do you do " i say " i do hardware " because it sort of conveniently encompasses everything i do and i recently said that to a venture capitalist casually at some valley event to which he replied " how quaint " and i sort of really was dumbstruck and i really should have said something smart and now i 've had a little bit of time to think about it i would have said " well you know if we look at the next 100 years and we 've seen all these problems in the last few days most of the big issues [UNK] clean water clean energy [UNK] and they 're interchangeable in some respects [UNK] and cleaner more functional materials [UNK] they all look to me to be hardware problems this does n't mean we should ignore software or information or computation " and that 's in fact probably what i 'm going to try and tell you about so this talk is going to be about how do we make things and what are the new ways that we 're going to make things in the future now ted sends you a lot of spam if you 're a speaker about " do this do that " and you fill out all these forms and you do n't actually know how they 're going to describe you and it flashed across my desk that they were going to introduce me as a futurist and i 've always been nervous about the term " futurist " because you seem doomed to failure because you ca n't really predict it and i was laughing about this with the very smart colleagues i have and said " you know well if i have to talk about the future what is it " and george homsey a great guy said " oh the future is amazing it is so much stranger than you think we 're going to reprogram the bacteria in your gut and we 're going to make your poo smell like peppermint " so you may think that 's sort of really crazy but there are some pretty amazing things that are happening that make this possible so this is n't my work but it 's work of good friends of mine at mit this is called the registry of standard biological parts this is headed by drew endy and tom knight and a few other very very bright individuals basically what they 're doing is looking at biology as a programmable system literally think of proteins as subroutines that you can string together to execute a program now this is actually becoming such an interesting idea this is a state diagram that 's an extremely simple computer this one is a two-bit counter so that 's essentially the computational equivalent of two light switches and this is being built by a group of students at zurich for a design competition in biology and from the results of the same competition last year a university of texas team of students programmed bacteria so that they can detect light and switch on and off so this is interesting in the sense that you can now do " if-then-for " statements in materials in structure this is a pretty interesting trend because we used to live in a world where everyone 's said glibly " form follows function " but i think i 've sort of grown up in a world [UNK] you listened to neil gershenfeld yesterday i was in a lab associated with his [UNK] where it 's really a world where information defines form and function i spent six years thinking about that but to show you the power of art over science [UNK] this is actually one of the cartoons i write these are called " howtoons " i work with a fabulous illustrator called nick dragotta took me six years at mit and about that many pages to describe what i was doing and it took him one page and so this is our muse tucker he 's an interesting little kid [UNK] and his sister celine [UNK] and what he 's doing here is observing the self-assembly of his cheerios in his cereal bowl and in fact you can program the self-assembly of things so he starts chocolate-dipping edges changing the hydrophobicity and the hydrophylicity in theory if you program those sufficiently you should be able to do something pretty interesting and make a very complex structure in this case he 's done self-replication of a complex 3d structure and that 's what i thought about for a long time because this is how we currently make things this is a silicon wafer and essentially that 's just a whole bunch of layers of two-dimensional stuff sort of layered up the feature side is [UNK] you know people will say [ unclear ] down around about 65 nanometers now on the right that 's a radiolara that 's a unicellular organism ubiquitous in the oceans and that has feature sizes down to about 20 nanometers and it 's a complex 3d structure we could do a lot more with computers and things generally if we knew how to build things this way the secret to biology is it builds computation into the way it makes things so this little thing here polymerase is essentially a supercomputer designed for replicating dna and the ribosome here is another little computer that helps in the translation of the proteins i thought about this in the sense that it 's great to build in biological materials but can we do similar things can we get self-replicating-type behavior can we get complex 3d structure automatically assembling in inorganic systems because there are some advantages to inorganic systems like higher speed semiconductors etc so this is some of my work on how do you do an autonomously self-replicating system and this is sort of babbage 's revenge these are little mechanical computers these are five-state state machines so that 's about three light switches lined up in a neutral state they wo n't bind at all now if i make a string of these a bit string they will be able to replicate so we start with white blue blue white that encodes that will now copy from one comes two and then from two comes three and so you 've got this sort of replicating system it was work actually by lionel penrose father of roger penrose the tiles guy he did a lot of this work in the '60s and so a lot of this logic theory lay fallow as we went down the digital computer revolution but it 's now coming back so now i 'm going to show you the hands-free autonomous self-replication so we 've tracked in the video the input string which was green green yellow yellow green we set them off on this air hockey table you know high science uses air hockey tables [UNK] [UNK] and if you watch this thing long enough you get dizzy but what you 're actually seeing is copies of that original string emerging from the parts bin that you have here so we 've got autonomous replication of bit strings so why would you want to replicate bit strings well it turns out biology has this other very interesting meme that you can take a linear string which is a convenient thing to copy and you can fold that into an arbitrarily complex 3d structure so i was trying to you know take the engineer 's version can we build a mechanical system in inorganic materials that will do the same thing so what i 'm showing you here is that we can make a 2d shape [UNK] the b [UNK] assemble from a string of components that follow extremely simple rules and the whole point of going with the extremely simple rules here and the incredibly simple state machines in the previous design was that you do n't need digital logic to do computation and that way you can scale things much smaller than microchips so you can literally use these as the tiny components in the assembly process so neil gershenfeld showed you this video on wednesday i believe but i 'll show you again this is literally the colored sequence of those tiles each different color has a different magnetic polarity and the sequence is uniquely specifying the structure that is coming out now hopefully those of you who know anything about graph theory can look at that and that will satisfy you that that can also do arbitrary 3d structure and in fact you know i can now take a dog carve it up and then reassemble it so it 's a linear string that will fold from a sequence and now i can actually define that three-dimensional object as a sequence of bits so you know it 's a pretty interesting world when you start looking at the world a little bit differently and the universe is now a compiler and so i 'm thinking about you know what are the programs for programming the physical universe and how do we think about materials and structure sort of as an information and computation problem not just where you attach a micro-controller to the end point but that the structure and the mechanisms are the logic are the computers having totally absorbed this philosophy i started looking at a lot of problems a little differently with the universe as a computer you can look at this droplet of water as having performed the computations you set a couple of boundary conditions like gravity the surface tension density etc. and then you press " execute " and magically the universe produces you a perfect ball lens so this actually applied to the problem of [UNK] so there 's a half a billion to a billion people in the world do n't have access to cheap eyeglasses so can you make a machine that could make any prescription lens very quickly on site this is a machine where you literally define a boundary condition if it 's circular you make a spherical lens if it 's elliptical you can make an astigmatic lens you then put a membrane on that and you apply pressure [UNK] so that 's part of the extra program and literally with only those two inputs [UNK] so the shape of your boundary condition and the pressure [UNK] you can define an infinite number of lenses that cover the range of human refractive error from minus 12 to plus eight diopters up to four diopters of cylinder and then literally you now pour on a monomer you know i 'll do a julia childs here this is three minutes of uv light and you reverse the pressure on your membrane once you 've cooked it pop it out i 've seen this video but i still do n't know if it 's going to end right so you reverse this this is a very old movie so with the new prototypes actually both surfaces are flexible but this will show you the point now you 've finished the lens you literally pop it out that 's next year 's yves klein you know eyeglasses shape and you can see that that has a mild prescription of about minus two diopters and as i rotate it against this side shot you 'll see that that has cylinder and that was programmed in [UNK] literally into the physics of the system so this sort of thinking about structure as computation and structure as information leads to other things like this this is something that my people at squid labs are working on at the moment called " electronic rope " so literally you think about a rope it has very complex structure in the weave and under no load it 's one structure under a different load it 's a different structure and you can actually exploit that by putting in a very small number of conducting fibers to actually make it a sensor so this is now a rope that knows the load on the rope at any particular point in the rope just by thinking about the physics of the world materials as the computer you can start to do things like this i 'm going to segue a little here i guess i 'm just going to casually tell you the types of things that i think about with this one thing i 'm really interested about this right now is how if you 're really taking this view of the universe as a computer how do we make things in a very general sense and how might we share the way we make things in a general sense the same way you share open source hardware and a lot of talks here have espoused the benefits of having lots of people look at problems share the information and work on those things together so a convenient thing about being a human is you move in linear time and unless lisa randall changes that we 'll continue to move in linear time so that means anything you do or anything you make you produce a sequence of steps [UNK] and i think lego in the '70s nailed this and they did it most elegantly but they can show you how to build things in sequence so i 'm thinking about how can we generalize the way we make all sorts of things so you end up with this sort of guy right and i think this applies across a very broad [UNK] sort of a lot of concepts you know cameron sinclair yesterday said " how do i get everyone to collaborate on design globally to do housing for humanity " and if you 've seen amy smith she talks about how you get students at mit to work with communities in haiti and i think we have to sort of redefine and rethink how we define structure and materials and assembly things so that we can really share the information on how you do those things in a more profound way and build on each other 's source code for structure i do n't know exactly how to do this yet but you know it 's something being actively thought about so you know that leads to questions like is this a compiler is this a sub-routine interesting things like that maybe i 'm getting a little too abstract but you know this is the sort of [UNK] returning to our comic characters [UNK] this is sort of the universe or a different universe view that i think is going to be very prevalent in the future [UNK] from biotech to materials assembly it was great to hear bill joy they 're starting to invest in materials science but these are the new things in materials science how do we put real information and real structure into new ideas and see the world in a different way and it 's not going to be binary code that defines the computers of the universe [UNK] it 's sort of an analog computer but it 's definitely an interesting new worldview i 've gone too far so that sounds like it 's it i 've probably got a couple of minutes of questions or i can show [UNK] i think they also said that i do extreme stuff in the introduction so i may have to explain that so maybe i 'll do that with this short video so this is actually a 3,000-square-foot kite which also happens to be a minimal energy surface so returning to the droplet again thinking about the universe in a new way this is a kite designed by a guy called dave kulp and why do you want a 3,000-square-foot kite so that 's a kite the size of your house and so you want that to tow boats very fast so i 've been working on this a little also with a couple of other guys but you know this is another way to look at the [UNK] if you abstract again this is a structure that is defined by the physics of the universe you could just hang it as a bed sheet but again the computation of all the physics gives you the aerodynamic shape and so you can actually sort of almost double your boat speed with systems like that so that 's sort of another interesting aspect of the future .i 've been intrigued by this question of whether we could evolve or develop a sixth sense [UNK] a sense that would give us seamless access and easy access to meta-information or information that may exist somewhere that may be relevant to help us make the right decision about whatever it is that we 're coming across and some of you may argue well do n't today 's cell phones do that already but i would say no when you meet someone here at ted [UNK] and this is the top networking place of course of the year [UNK] you do n't shake somebody 's hand and then say " can you hold on for a moment while i take out my phone and google you " or when you go to the supermarket and you 're standing there in that huge aisle of different types of toilet papers you do n't take out your cell phone and open a browser and go to a website to try to decide which of these different toilet papers is the most ecologically responsible purchase to make so we do n't really have easy access to all this relevant information that can just help us make optimal decisions about what to do next and what actions to take and so my research group at the media lab has been developing a series of inventions to give us access to this information in a sort of easy way without requiring that the user changes any of their behavior and i 'm here to unveil our latest effort and most successful effort so far which is still very much a work in process i 'm actually wearing the device right now and we 've sort of cobbled it together with components that are off the shelf [UNK] and that by the way only cost 350 dollars at this point in time i 'm wearing a camera just a simple webcam a portable battery-powered projection system with a little mirror these components communicate to my cell phone in my pocket which acts as the communication and computation device and in the video here we see my student pranav mistry who 's really the genius who 's been implementing and designing this whole system and we see how this system lets him walk up to any surface and start using his hands to interact with the information that is projected in front of him the system tracks the four significant fingers in this case he 's wearing simple marker caps that you may recognize but if you want a more stylish version you could also paint your nails in different colors and the camera basically tracks these four fingers and recognizes any gestures that he 's making so he can just go to for example a map of long beach zoom in and out etc the system also recognizes iconic gestures such as the " take a picture " gesture and then takes a picture of whatever is in front of you and when he then walks back to the media lab he can just go up to any wall and project all the pictures that he 's taken sort through them and organize them and re-size them etc. again using all natural gestures so some of you most likely were here two years ago and saw the demo by jeff han or some of you may think " well does n't this look like the microsoft surface table " and yes you also interact using natural gestures both hands etc but the difference here is that you can use any surface you can walk to up to any surface including your hand if nothing else is available and interact with this projected data the device is completely portable and can be 1 so one important difference is that it 's totally mobile another even more important difference is that in mass production this would not cost more tomorrow than today 's cell phones and would actually not sort of be a bigger packaging [UNK] could look a lot more stylish than this version that i 'm wearing around my neck but other than letting some of you live out your fantasy of looking as cool as tom cruise in " minority report " the reason why we 're really excited about this device is that it really can act as one of these sixth-sense devices that gives you relevant information about whatever is in front of you so we see pranav here going into the supermarket and he 's shopping for some paper towels and as he picks up a product the system can recognize the product that he 's picking up using either image recognition or marker technology and give him the green light or an orange light he can ask for additional information so this particular choice here is a particularly good choice given his personal criteria some of you may want the toilet paper with the most bleach in it rather than the most ecologically-responsible choice if he picks up a book in the bookstore he can get an amazon rating [UNK] it gets projected right on the cover of the book this is juan 's book our previous speaker which gets a great rating by the way at amazon and so pranav turns the page of the book and can then see additional information about the book [UNK] reader comments maybe sort of information by his favorite critic etc if he turns to a particular page he finds an annotation by maybe an expert of a friend of ours that gives him a little bit of additional information about whatever is on that particular page reading the newspaper [UNK] it never has to be outdated you can get video annotations of the event that you 're reading about you can get the latest sports scores etc this is a more controversial one as you interact with someone at ted maybe you can see a word cloud of the tags the words that are associated with that person in their blog and personal web pages in this case the student is interested in cameras etc on your way to the airport if you pick up your boarding pass it can tell you that your flight is delayed that the gate has changed etc and if you need to know what the current time is it 's as simple as drawing a watch [UNK] on your arm so that 's where we 're at so far in developing this sixth sense that would give us seamless access to all this relevant information about the things that we may come across my student pranav who 's really like i said the genius behind this he does deserve a lot of applause because i do n't think he 's slept much in the last three months actually and his girlfriend is probably not very happy about him either but it 's not perfect yet it 's very much a work in progress and who knows maybe in another 10 years we 'll be here with the ultimate sixth sense brain implant thank you .meet tony he 's my student he 's about my age and he 's in san quentin state prison when tony was 16 years old one day one moment " it was mom 's gun just flash it scare the guy he 's a punk he took some money we 'll take his money that 'll teach him then last minute i 'm thinking 'ca n't do this this is wrong ' my buddy says 'c'mon let 's do this ' i say 'let 's do this ' " and those three words tony 's going to remember because the next thing he knows he hears the pop there 's the punk on the ground puddle of blood and that 's felony murder [UNK] 25 to life parole at 50 if you 're lucky and tony 's not feeling very lucky so when we meet in my philosophy class in his prison and i say " in this class we will discuss the foundations of ethics " tony interrupts me " what are you going to teach me about right and wrong i know what is wrong i have done wrong i am told every day by every face i see every wall i face that i am wrong if i ever get out of here there will always be a mark by my name i 'm a convict i am branded 'wrong ' what are you going to tell me about right and wrong " so i say to tony " sorry but it 's worse than you think you think you know right and wrong then can you tell me what wrong is no do n't just give me an example i want to know about wrongness itself the idea of wrong what is that idea what makes something wrong how do we know that it 's wrong maybe you and i disagree maybe one of us is wrong about the wrong maybe it 's you maybe it 's me [UNK] but we 're not here to trade opinions everyone 's got an opinion we are here for knowledge our enemy is thoughtlessness this is philosophy " and something changes for tony " could be i 'm wrong i 'm tired of being wrong i want to know what is wrong i want to know what i know " what tony sees in that moment is the project of philosophy the project that begins in wonder [UNK] what kant called " admiration and awe at the starry sky above and the moral law within " what can creatures like us know of such things it is the project that always takes us back to the condition of existence [UNK] what heidegger called " the always already there " it is the project of questioning what we believe and why we believe it [UNK] what socrates called " the examined life " socrates a man wise enough to know that he knows nothing socrates died in prison his philosophy intact so tony starts doing his homework he learns his whys and wherefores his causes and correlations his logic his fallacies turns out tony 's got the philosophy muscle his body is in prison but his mind is free tony learns about the ontologically promiscuous the epistemologically anxious the ethically dubious the metaphysically ridiculous that 's plato descartes nietzsche and bill clinton so when he gives me his final paper in which he argues that the categorical imperative is perhaps too uncompromising to deal with the conflict that affects our everyday and challenges me to tell him whether therefore we are condemned to moral failure i say " i do n't know let us think about that " because in that moment there 's no mark by tony 's name it 's just the two of us standing there it is not professor and convict it is just two minds ready to do philosophy and i say to tony " let 's do this " thank you .at the break i was asked by several people about my comments about the aging debate and this will be my only comment on it and that is i understand that optimists greatly outlive pessimists what i 'm going to tell you about in my 18 minutes is how we 're about to switch from reading the genetic code to the first stages of beginning to write the code ourselves it 's only 10 years ago this month when we published the first sequence of a free-living organism that of haemophilus influenzae that took a genome project from 13 years down to four months we can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hours so in the last decade a large number of genomes have been added most human pathogens a couple of plants several insects and several mammals including the human genome genomics at this stage of the thinking from a little over 10 years ago was by the end of this year we might have between three and five genomes sequenced it 's on the order of several hundred we just got a grant from the gordon and betty moore foundation to sequence 130 genomes this year as a side project from environmental organisms so the rate of reading the genetic code has changed but as we look what 's out there we 've barely scratched the surface on what is available on this planet most people do n't realize it because they 're invisible but microbes make up about a half of the earth 's biomass whereas all animals only make up about one one-thousandth of all the biomass and maybe it 's something that people in oxford do n't do very often but if you ever make it to the sea and you swallow a mouthful of seawater keep in mind that each milliliter has about a million bacteria and on the order of 10 million viruses less than 5,000 microbial species have been characterized as of two years ago and so we decided to do something about it and we started the sorcerer ii expedition where we were as with great oceanographic expeditions trying to sample the ocean every 200 miles we started in bermuda for our test project then moved up to halifax working down the u.s. east coast the caribbean sea the panama canal through to the galapagos then across the pacific and we 're in the process now of working our way across the indian ocean it 's very tough duty we 're doing this on a sailing vessel in part to help excite young people about going into science the experiments are incredibly simple we just take seawater and we filter it and we collect different size organisms on different filters and then take their dna back to our lab in rockville where we can sequence a hundred million letters of the genetic code every 24 hours and with doing this we 've made some amazing discoveries for example it was thought that the visual pigments that are in our eyes [UNK] there was only one or two organisms in the environment that had these same pigments it turns out almost every species in the upper parts of the ocean in warm parts of the world have these same photoreceptors and use sunlight as the source of their energy and communication from one site from one barrel of seawater we discovered 1.3 million new genes and as many as 50,000 new species we 've extended this to the air now with a grant from the sloan foundation we 're measuring how many viruses and bacteria all of us are breathing in and out every day particularly on airplanes or closed auditoriums we filter through some simple apparatuses we collect on the order of a billion microbes from just a day filtering on top of a building in new york city and we 're in the process of sequencing all that at the present time just on the data collection side just where we are through the galapagos we 're finding that almost every 200 miles we see tremendous diversity in the samples in the ocean some of these make logical sense in terms of different temperature gradients so this is a satellite photograph based on temperatures [UNK] red being warm blue being cold [UNK] and we found there 's a tremendous difference between the warm water samples and the cold water samples in terms of abundant species the other thing that surprised us quite a bit is these photoreceptors detect different wavelengths of light and we can predict that based on their amino acid sequence and these vary tremendously from region to region maybe not surprisingly in the deep ocean where it 's mostly blue the photoreceptors tend to see blue light when there 's a lot of chlorophyll around they see a lot of green light but they vary even more possibly moving towards infrared and ultraviolet in the extremes just to try and get an assessment of what our gene repertoire was we assembled all the data [UNK] including all of ours thus far from the expedition which represents more than half of all the gene data on the planet [UNK] and it totaled around 29 million genes and we tried to put these into gene families to see what these discoveries are are we just discovering new members of known families or are we discovering new families and it turns out we have about 50,000 major gene families but every new sample we take in the environment adds in a linear fashion to these new families so we 're at the earliest stages of discovery about basic genes components and life on this planet when we look at the so-called evolutionary tree we 're up on the upper right-hand corner with the animals of those roughly 29 million genes we only have around 24,000 in our genome and if you take all animals together we probably share less than 30,000 and probably maybe a dozen or more thousand different gene families i view that these genes are now not only the design components of evolution and we think in a gene-centric view [UNK] maybe going back to richard dawkins ' ideas [UNK] than in a genome-centric view which are different constructs of these gene components synthetic dna the ability to synthesize dna has changed at sort of the same pace that dna sequencing has over the last decade or two and is getting very rapid and very cheap our first thought about synthetic genomics came when we sequenced the second genome back in 1995 and that from mycoplasma genitalium and we have really nice t-shirts that say you know " i heart my genitalium " this is actually just a microorganism but it has roughly 500 genes haemophilus had 1,800 genes and we simply asked the question if one species needs 800 another 500 is there a smaller set of genes that might comprise a minimal operating system so we started doing transposon mutagenesis transposons are just small pieces of dna that randomly insert in the genetic code and if they insert in the middle of the gene they disrupt its function so we made a map of all the genes that could take transposon insertions and we called those " non-essential genes " but it turns out the environment is very critical for this and you can only define an essential or non-essential gene based on exactly what 's in the environment we also tried to take a more directly intellectual approach with the genomes of 13 related organisms and we tried to compare all of those to see what they had in common and we got these overlapping circles and we found only 173 genes common to all 13 organisms the pool expanded a little bit if we ignored one intracellular parasite it expanded even more when we looked at core sets of genes of around 310 or so so we think that we can expand or contract genomes depending on your point of view here to maybe 300 to 400 genes from the minimal of 500 the only way to prove these ideas was to construct an artificial chromosome with those genes in them and we had to do this in a cassette-based fashion we found that synthesizing accurate dna in large pieces was extremely difficult ham smith and clyde hutchison my colleagues on this developed an exciting new method that allowed us to synthesize a 5,000-base pair virus in only a two-week period that was 100 percent accurate in terms of its sequence and its biology it was a quite exciting experiment [UNK] when we just took the synthetic piece of dna injected it in the bacteria and all of a sudden that dna started driving the production of the virus particles that turned around and then killed the bacteria this was not the first synthetic virus [UNK] a polio virus had been made a year before [UNK] but it was only one ten-thousandth as active and it took three years to do this is a cartoon of the structure of phi x 174 this is a case where the software now builds its own hardware and that 's the notions that we have with biology people immediately jump to concerns about biological warfare and i had recent testimony before a senate committee and a special committee the u.s. government has set up to review this area and i think it 's important to keep reality in mind versus what happens with people 's imaginations basically any virus that 's been sequenced today [UNK] that genome can be made and people immediately freak out about things about ebola or smallpox but the dna from this organism is not infective so even if somebody made the smallpox genome that dna itself would not cause infections the real concern that security departments have is designer viruses and there 's only two countries the u.s. and the former soviet union that had major efforts on trying to create biological warfare agents if that research is truly discontinued there should be very little activity on the know-how to make designer viruses in the future i think single-cell organisms are possible within two years and possibly eukaryotic cells those that we have are possible within a decade so we 're now making several dozen different constructs because we can vary the cassettes and the genes that go into this artificial chromosome the key is how do you put all of the others we start with these fragments and then we have a homologous recombination system that reassembles those into a chromosome this is derived from an organism deinococcus radiodurans that can take three million rads of radiation and not be killed it reassembles its genome after this radiation burst in about 12 to 24 hours after its chromosomes are literally blown apart this organism is ubiquitous on the planet and exists perhaps now in outer space due to all our travel there this is a glass beaker after about half a million rads of radiation the glass started to burn and crack while the microbes sitting in the bottom just got happier and happier here 's an actual picture of what happens the top of this shows the genome after 1.7 million rads of radiation the chromosome is literally blown apart and here 's that same dna automatically reassembled 24 hours later it 's truly stunning that these organisms can do that and we probably have thousands if not tens of thousands of different species on this planet that are capable of doing that after these genomes are synthesized the first step is just transplanting them into a cell without a genome so we think synthetic cells are going to have tremendous potential not only for understanding the basis of biology but for hopefully environmental and society issues for example from the third organism we sequenced methanococcus jannaschii [UNK] it lives in boiling water temperatures its energy source is hydrogen and all its carbon comes from co2 it captures back from the environment so we know lots of different pathways thousands of different organisms now that live off of co2 and can capture that back so instead of using carbon from oil for synthetic processes we have the chance of using carbon and capturing it back from the atmosphere converting that into biopolymers or other products we have one organism that lives off of carbon monoxide and we use as a reducing power to split water to produce hydrogen and oxygen also there 's numerous pathways that can be engineered metabolizing methane and dupont has a major program with statoil in norway to capture and convert the methane from the gas fields there into useful products within a short while i think there 's going to be a new field called " combinatorial genomics " because with these new synthesis capabilities these vast gene array repertoires and the homologous recombination we think we can design a robot to make maybe a million different chromosomes a day and therefore as with all biology you get selection through screening whether you 're screening for hydrogen production or chemical production or just viability to understand the role of these genes is going to be well within reach we 're trying to modify photosynthesis to produce hydrogen directly from sunlight photosynthesis is modulated by oxygen and we have an oxygen-insensitive hydrogenase that we think will totally change this process we 're also combining cellulases the enzymes that break down complex sugars into simple sugars and fermentation in the same cell for producing ethanol pharmaceutical production is already under way in major laboratories using microbes the chemistry from compounds in the environment is orders of magnitude more complex than our best chemists can produce i think future engineered species could be the source of food hopefully a source of energy environmental remediation and perhaps replacing the petrochemical industry let me just close with ethical and policy studies we delayed the start of our experiments in 1999 until we completed a year-and-a-half bioethical review as to whether we should try and make an artificial species every major religion participated in this it was actually a very strange study because the various religious leaders were using their scriptures as law books and they could n't find anything in them prohibiting making life so it must be ok the only ultimate concerns were biological warfare aspects of this but gave us the go ahead to start these experiments for the reasons we were doing them right now the sloan foundation has just funded a multi-institutional study on this to work out what the risk and benefits to society are and the rules that scientific teams such as my own should be using in this area and we 're trying to set good examples as we go forward these are complex issues except for the threat of bio-terrorism they 're very simple issues in terms of can we design things to produce clean energy perhaps revolutionizing what developing countries can do and provide through various simple processes thank you very much .in 1962 charles van doren who was later a senior editor of britannica said the ideal encyclopedia should be radical [UNK] it should stop being safe but if you know anything about the history of britannica since 1962 it was anything but radical still a very completely safe stodgy type of encyclopedia wikipedia on the other hand begins with a very radical idea and that 's for all of us to imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge and that 's what we 're doing so wikipedia [UNK] you just saw the little demonstration of it [UNK] it 's a freely licensed encyclopedia it 's written by thousands of volunteers all over the world in many many languages it 's written using wiki software [UNK] which is the type of software he just demonstrated [UNK] so anyone can quickly edit and save and it goes live on the internet immediately and everything about wikipedia is managed by virtually an all-volunteer staff so when yochai is talking about new methods of organization he 's exactly describing wikipedia and what i 'm going to do today is tell you a little bit more about how it really works on the inside so wikipedia 's owned by the wikimedia foundation which i founded a nonprofit organization and our goal the core aim of the wikimedia foundation is to get a free encyclopedia to every single person on the planet and so if you think about what that means it means a lot more than just building a cool website we 're really interested in all the issues of the digital divide poverty worldwide empowering people everywhere to have the information that they need to make good decisions and so we 're going to have to do a lot of work that goes beyond just the internet and so that 's a big part of why we 've chosen the free licensing model because that empowers local entrepreneurs [UNK] or anyone who wants to can take our content and do anything they like with it [UNK] you can copy it redistribute it and you can do it commercially or non-commercially so there 's a lot of opportunities that are going to arise around wikipedia all over the world we 're funded by donations from the public and one of the more interesting things about that is how little money it actually takes to run wikipedia so yochai showed you the graph of what the cost of a printing press was and i 'm going to tell you what the cost of wikipedia is but first i 'll show you how big it is so we 've got over 600,000 articles in english we 've got two million total articles across many many different languages the biggest languages are german japanese french [UNK] all the western european languages are quite big but only around one-third of all of our traffic to our web clusters to the english wikipedia which is surprising to a lot of people a lot of people think in a very english-centric way on the internet but for us we 're truly global we 're in many many languages how popular we 've gotten to be [UNK] we 're a top 50 website and we 're more popular than the new york times so this is where we get to yochai 's discussion this shows the growth of wikipedia [UNK] we 're the blue line there [UNK] and then this is the new york times over there and what 's interesting about this is the new york times website is a huge enormous corporate operation with [UNK] i have no idea how many hundreds of employees we have exactly one employee and that employee is our lead software developer and he 's only been our employee since january 2005 all the other growth before that so the servers are managed by a rag-tag band of volunteers all the editing is done by volunteers and the way that we 're organized is not like any traditional organization you can imagine people are always asking " well who 's in charge of this " or " who does that " and the answer is anybody who wants to pitch in it 's a very unusual and chaotic thing we 've got over 90 servers now in three locations these are managed by volunteer system administrators who are online i can go online any time of the day or night and see eight to 10 people waiting for me to ask a question or something anything about the servers you could never afford to do this in a company you could never afford to have a standby crew of people 24 hours a day and do what we 're doing at wikipedia so we 're doing around 1.4 billion page views monthly so it 's really gotten to be a huge thing and everything is managed by the volunteers and the total monthly cost for our bandwidth is about 5,000 dollars and that 's essentially our main cost we could actually do without the employee we actually [UNK] we hired brian because he was working part-time for two years and full-time at wikipedia so we actually hired him so he could get a life and go to the movies sometimes so the big question when you 've got this really chaotic organization is why is n't it all rubbish why is the website as good as it is first of all how good is it well it 's pretty good it is n't perfect but it 's much much better than you would expect given our completely chaotic model so when you saw him make a ridiculous edit to the page about me you think oh this is obviously just going to degenerate into rubbish but when we 've seen quality tests [UNK] and there have n't been enough of these yet and i 'm really encouraging people to do more comparing wikipedia to traditional things [UNK] we win hands down so a german magazine compared german wikipedia which is really much much smaller than english to microsoft encarta and to brockhaus multimedia and we won across the board they hired experts to come and look at articles and compare the quality and we were very pleased with that result so a lot of people have heard about the wikipedia bush-kerry controversy the media has covered this somewhat extensively it started out with an article in red herring the reporters called me up and they [UNK] i mean i have to say they spelled my name right but they really wanted to say the bush-kerry election is so contentious it 's tearing apart the wikipedia community and so they quote me as saying " they 're the most contentious in the history of wikipedia " what i actually said is they 're not contentious at all so it 's a slight misquote the articles were edited quite heavily and it is true that we did have to lock the articles on a couple of occasions time magazine recently reported that " extreme action sometimes has to be taken and wales locked the entries on kerry and bush for most of 2004 " this came after i told the reporter that we had to lock it for [UNK] occasionally a little bit here and there so the truth in general is that the kinds of controversies that you would probably think we have within the wikipedia community are not really controversies at all articles on controversial topics are edited a lot but they do n't cause much controversy within the community and the reason for this is that most people understand the need for neutrality the real struggle is not between the right and the left [UNK] that 's where most people assume [UNK] but it 's between the party of the thoughtful and the party of the jerks and no side of the political spectrum has a monopoly on either of those qualities the actual truth about the specific bush-kerry incident is that the bush-kerry articles were locked less than one percent of the time in 2004 and it was n't because they were contentious it was just because there was routine vandalism [UNK] which happens sometimes even on stage people [UNK] sometimes even reporters have reported to me that they vandalize wikipedia and were amazed that it was fixed so quickly and i said [UNK] you know i always say please do n't do that that 's not a good thing so how do we do this how do we manage the quality control how does it work so there 's a few elements mostly social policies and some elements of the software so the biggest and the most important thing is our neutral point-of-view policy this is something that i set down from the very beginning as a core principle of the community that 's completely not debatable it 's a social concept of cooperation so we do n't talk a lot about truth and objectivity the reason for this is if we say we 're only going to write the " truth " about some topic that does n't do us a damn bit of good of figuring out what to write because i do n't agree with you about what 's the truth but we have this jargon term of neutrality which has its own long history within the community which basically says any time there 's a controversial issue wikipedia itself should not take a stand on the issue we should merely report on what reputable parties have said about it so this neutrality policy is really important for us because it empowers a community that is very diverse to come together and actually get some work done so we have very diverse contributors in terms of political religious cultural backgrounds by having this firm neutrality policy which is non-negotiable from the beginning we ensure that people can work together and that the entries do n't become simply a war back and forth between the left and the right if you engage in that type of behavior you 'll be asked to leave the community so real-time peer review every single change on the site goes to the recent changes page so as soon as he made his change it went to the recent changes page that recent changes page was also fed into irc channel which is an internet chat channel that people are monitoring with various software tools and people can get rss feeds [UNK] they can get e-mail notifications of changes and then users can set up their own personal watch list so my page is on quite a few volunteers ' watch lists because it is sometimes vandalized and therefore what happens is someone will notice the change very quickly and then they 'll just simply revert the change there 's a new pages feed for example so you can go to a certain page of wikipedia and see every new page as it 's created this is really important because a lot of new pages that get created are just garbage that have to be deleted you know asdfasdf but also that 's some of the most interesting and fun things at wikipedia some of the new articles people will start an article on some interesting topic other people will find that intriguing and jump in and help and make it much better so we do have edits by anonymous users which is one of the most controversial and intriguing things about wikipedia so chris was able to do his change [UNK] he did n't have to log in or anything he just went on the website and made a change but it turns out that only about 18 percent of all the edits to the website are done by anonymous users and that 's a really important thing to understand is that the vast majority of the edits that go on on the website are from a very close-knit community of maybe 600 to 1,000 people who are in constant communication and we have over 40 irc channels 40 mailing lists all these people know each other they communicate we have offline meetings these are the people who are doing the bulk of the site and they are in a sense semi-professionals at what they 're doing that the standards we set for ourselves are equal to or higher than professional standards of quality we do n't always meet those standards but that 's what we 're striving for and so that tight community is who really cares for the site and these are some of the smartest people i 've ever met of course it 's my job to say that but it 's actually true the type of people who were drawn to writing an encyclopedia for fun tend to be pretty smart people the tools and the software there 's lots of tools that allow us [UNK] allow us meaning the community [UNK] to self-monitor and to monitor all the work this is an example of a page history on " flat earth " and you can see some changes that were made what 's nice about this page is you can immediately take a look at this and see oh ok i understand now when somebody goes and looks at [UNK] they see that someone an anonymous ip number made an edit to my page [UNK] that sounds suspicious [UNK] who is this person somebody looks at it [UNK] they can immediately see highlighted in red all of the changes that took place to see ok well these words have changed things like this so that 's one tool that we can use to very quickly monitor the history of a page another thing that we do within the community is we leave everything very open-ended most of the social rules and the methods of work are left completely open-ended in the software all of that stuff is just on wiki pages and so there 's nothing in the software that enforces the rules the example i 've got up here is a votes for deletion page so i mentioned earlier people type asdfasdf [UNK] it needs to be deleted cases like that the administrators just delete it there 's no reason to have a big argument about it but you can imagine there 's a lot of other areas where the question is is this notable enough to go in an encyclopedia is the information verifiable is it a hoax is it true is it what so we needed a social method for figuring out the answer to this and so the method that arose organically within the community is the votes for deletion page and in the particular example we have here it 's a film " twisted issues " and the first person says " now this is supposedly a film it fails the google test miserably " the google test is you look in google and see if it 's there because if something 's not even in google it probably does n't exist at all it 's not a perfect rule but it 's a nice starting point for quick research so somebody says " delete it please delete it [UNK] it 's not notable " and then somebody says " wait wait wait wait i found it i found it in a book 'film threat video guide the 20 underground films you must see ' " oh ok so the next persons says " clean it up " somebody says " i 've found it on imdb keep keep keep " and what 's interesting about this is that the software is [UNK] these votes are just [UNK] they 're just text typed into a page this is not really a vote so much as it is a dialogue now it is true that at the end of the day an administrator can go through here and take a look at this and say ok 18 deletes two keeps we 'll delete it but in other cases this could be 18 deletes and two keeps and we would keep it because if those last two keeps say " wait a minute wait a minute nobody else saw this but i found it in a book and i found a link to a page that describes it and i 'm going to clean it up tomorrow so please do n't delete it " then it would survive and it also matters who the people are who are voting like i say it 's a tight knit community down here at the bottom " keep real movie " rick kay rick kay is a very famous wikipedian who does an enormous amount of work with vandalism hoaxes and votes for deletion his voice carries a lot of weight within the community because he knows what he 's doing so how 's all this governed people really want to know about ok administrators things like that so the wikipedia governance model the governance of the community is a very confusing but a workable mix of consensus [UNK] meaning we try not to vote on the content of articles because the majority view is not necessarily neutral some amount of democracy all of the administrators [UNK] these are the people who have the ability to delete pages that does n't mean that they have the right to delete pages they still have to follow all the rules [UNK] but they 're elected they 're elected by the community sometimes people [UNK] random trolls on the internet [UNK] like to accuse me of handpicking the administrators to bias the content of the encyclopedia i always laugh at this because i have no idea how they 're elected actually there 's a certain amount of aristocracy and so you 've got a hint of that when i mentioned like rick kay 's voice would carry a lot more weight than someone we do n't know i give this talk sometimes with angela who was just re-elected to the board from the community [UNK] to the board of the foundation with more than twice the votes of the person who did n't make it and i always embarrass her because i say well angela for example could get away with doing absolutely anything within wikipedia because she 's so admired and so powerful but the irony is of course that angela can do this because she 's the one person who you know would never ever ever break any rules of wikipedia and i also like to say she 's the only person who actually knows all the rules of wikipedia so 1 and then there 's monarchy and that 's my role on the community so 1 i was describing this in berlin once and the next day in the newspaper the headline said " i am the queen of england " and that 's not exactly what i said but [UNK] the point is my role in the community [UNK] within the free software world there 's been a longstanding tradition of the " benevolent dictator " model so if you look at most of the major free software projects they have one single person in charge who everyone agrees is the benevolent dictator well i do n't like the term " benevolent dictator " and i do n't think that it 's my job or my role in the world of ideas to be the dictator of the future of all human knowledge compiled by the world it just is n't appropriate but there is a need still for a certain amount of monarchy a certain amount of [UNK] sometimes we have to make a decision and we do n't want to get bogged down too heavily in formal decision-making processes so as an example of why this has been [UNK] or how this can be important we recently had a situation where a neo-nazi website discovered wikipedia and they said " oh well this is horrible this jewish conspiracy of a website and we 're going to get certain articles deleted that we do n't like and we see they have a voting process so we 're going to send [UNK] we have 40,000 members and we 're going to send them over and they 're all going to vote and get these pages deleted " well they managed to get 18 people to show up that 's neo-nazi math for you they always think they 've got 40,000 members when they 've got 18 but they managed to get 18 people to come and vote in a fairly absurd way to delete a perfectly valid article of course the vote ended up being about 85 to 18 so there was no real danger to our democratic processes on the other hand people said " but what are we going to do i mean this could happen and what if some group gets really seriously organized and comes in and wants to vote " then i said " well fuck it we 'll just change the rules " that 's my job in the community to say we wo n't allow our openness and freedom to undermine the quality of the content and so as long as people trust me in my role then that 's a valid place for me of course because of the free licensing if i do a bad job the volunteers are more than happy to take and leave [UNK] i ca n't tell anyone what to do so the final point here is that to understand how wikipedia works it 's important to understand that our wiki model is the way we work but we are not fanatical web anarchists in fact we 're very flexible about the social methodology because it 's ultimately the passion of the community is for the quality of the work not necessarily for the process that we use to generate it thank you ben saunders yeah hi ben saunders jimmy you mentioned impartiality being a key to wikipedia 's success it strikes me that much of the textbooks that are used to educate our children are inherently biased have you found wikipedia being used by teachers and how do you see wikipedia changing education jimmy wales yeah so a lot of teachers are beginning to use wikipedia there 's a media storyline about wikipedia which i think is false it builds on the storyline of bloggers versus newspapers and the storyline is there 's this crazy thing wikipedia but academics hate it and teachers hate it and that turns out to not be true the last time i got an e-mail from a journalist saying " why do academics hate wikipedia " i sent it from my harvard email address because i was recently appointed a fellow there and i said " well they do n't all hate it " but i think there 's going to be huge impacts and we actually have a project that i 'm personally really excited about which is the wiki books project which is an effort to create textbooks in all the languages and that 's a much bigger project it 's going to take 20 years or so to come to fruition but part of that is to fulfill our mission of giving an encyclopedia to every single person on the planet we do n't mean we 're going to spam them with aol-style cds we mean we 're going to give them a tool that they can use and for a lot of people in the world if i give you an encyclopedia that 's written at a university level it does n't do you any good without a whole host of literacy materials to build you up to the point where you can actually use it and so the wiki books project is an effort to do that and i think that we 're going to really see a huge [UNK] it may not even come from us there 's all kinds of innovation going on but freely licensed textbooks are the next big thing in education .it was an incredible surprise to me to find out that there was actually an organization that cared about both parts of my life because basically i work as a theoretical physicist i develop and test models of the big bang using observational data and i 've been moonlighting for the last five years helping with a project in africa and i get a lot of flak for this at cambridge people wonder you know " how do you have time to do this " and so on and so it was simply astonishing to me to find an organization that actually appreciated both those sides so i thought i 'd start off by just telling you a little bit about myself and why i lead this schizophrenic life well i was born in south africa and my parents were imprisoned for resisting the racist regime when they were released we left and we went as refugees to kenya and tanzania both were very young countries then and full of hope for the future we had an amazing childhood we did n't have any money but we were outdoors most of the time we had fantastic friends and we saw the wonders of the world like kilimanjaro serengeti and the olduvai gorge well then we moved to london for high school and after that [UNK] there 's nothing much to say about that it was rather dull but i came back to africa at the age of 17 as a volunteer teacher to lesotho which is a tiny country surrounded at that time by apartheid south africa well 80 percent of the men in lesotho worked in the mines over the border in brutal conditions nevertheless i [UNK] as i 'm sure [UNK] as a rather irritating young white man coming into their village i was welcomed with incredible hospitality and warmth but the kids were the best part the kids were amazing extremely eager and often very bright and i 'm just going to tell you one story which got through to me i used to try to take the kids outside as often as possible to try to connect the academic stuff with the real world and they were n't used to that but i took them outside one day and i said " i want you to estimate the height of the building " and i expected them to put a ruler next to the wall size it up with a finger and make an estimate of the height but there was one little boy very small for his age he was the son of one of the poorest families in the village and he was n't doing that he was scribbling with chalk on the pavement and so i said [UNK] i was annoyed [UNK] i said " what are you doing i want you to estimate the height of the building " he said " ok i measured the height of a brick i counted the number of bricks and now i 'm multiplying " well [UNK] [UNK] i had n't thought of that one and many experiences like this happened to me another one is that i met a miner he was home on his three-month leave from the mines sitting next to him one day he said " there 's only one thing that i really loved at school and you know what it was shakespeare " and he recited some to me and these and many similar experiences convinced me that there are just tons of bright kids in africa [UNK] inventive kids intellectual kids [UNK] and starved of opportunity and if africa is going to get fixed it 's by them not by us well after [UNK] [UNK] that 's the truth well after lesotho i traveled across africa before returning to england [UNK] so gray and depressing in comparison and i went to cambridge and there i fell for theoretical physics well i 'm not going to explain this equation but theoretical physics is really an amazing subject we can write down all the laws of physics we know in one line and admittedly it 's in a very shorthand notation and it contains 18 free parameters ok which we have to fit to the data so it 's not the final story but it 's an incredibly powerful summary of everything we know about nature at the most basic level and apart from a few very important loose ends which you 've heard about here [UNK] like dark energy and dark matter [UNK] this equation describes seems to describe everything about the universe and what 's in it but there 's one big puzzle remaining and this was most succinctly put to me by my primary school math teacher in tanzania who 's a wonderful scottish lady who i still stay in touch with and she 's now in her 80s and when i try to explain my work to her she waved away all the details and she said " neil there 's only one question that really matters what banged " " everyone talks about the big bang what banged " and she 's right it 's a question we 've all been avoiding the standard explanation is that the universe somehow sprang into existence full of a strange kind of energy [UNK] inflationary energy [UNK] which blew it up but the puzzle of why the universe emerged in that peculiar state is completely unsolved now i worked on that theory for a while with stephen hawking and others but then i began to explore another alternative the alternative is that the big bang was n't the beginning perhaps the universe existed before the bang and the bang was just a violent event in a pre-existing universe well this possibility is actually suggested by the latest theories the unified theories which try to explain all those 18 free parameters in a single framework which will hopefully predict all of them and i 'll just share a cartoon of this idea here it 's all i can convey according to these theories there are extra dimensions of space not just the three we 're familiar with but at every point in the room there are more dimensions and in particular there 's one rather strange one in the most elegant unified theories we have the strange one looks likes this that we live in a three-dimensional world we live in one of these worlds and i can only show it as a sheet but it 's really three-dimensional and a tiny distance away there 's another sheet also three-dimensional and they 're separated by a gap the gap is very tiny and i 've blown it up so you can see it but it 's really a tiny fraction of the size of an atomic nucleus i wo n't go into the details of why we think the universe is like this but it comes out of the math and trying to explain the physics that we know well i got interested in this because it seemed to me that it was an obvious question which is what happens if these two three-dimensional worlds should actually collide and if they collide it would look a lot like the big bang but it 's slightly different than in the conventional picture the conventional picture of the big bang is a point everything comes out of a point you have infinite density and all the equations break down no hope of describing that in this picture you 'll notice the bang is extended it 's not a point the density of matter is finite and we have a chance of a consistent set of equations that can describe the whole process so to cut a long story short we 've explored this alternative we 've shown that it can fit all of the data that we have about the formation of galaxies the fluctuations in the microwave background furthermore there 's an experimental way to tell this theory apart from the inflationary explanation that i told you before it involves gravitational waves and in this scenario not only was the big bang not the beginning as you can see from the picture it can happen over and over again it may be that we live in an endless universe both in space and in time and there 've been bangs in the past and there will be bangs in the future and maybe we live in an endless universe well making and testing models of the universe is for me the best way i have of enjoying and appreciating the universe we need to make the best mathematical models we can the most consistent ones and then we scrutinize them logically and with data and we try to convince ourselves [UNK] we really try to convince ourselves they 're wrong that 's progress when we prove things wrong and gradually we hopefully move closer and closer to understanding the world as i pursued my career something was always gnawing away inside me what about africa what about those kids i 'd left behind instead of developing as we 'd all hoped in the '60s things had gotten worse africa was gripped by poverty disease and war this is very graphically shown by the worldmapper website and project and so the idea is to represent each country on a map but scale the area according to some quantity so here 's just the standard area map of the world by the way africa is very large and the next map now shows africa 's gdp in 1960 around the time of independence for many african states now this is 1990 and then 2002 and here 's a projection for 2015 big changes are happening in the world but they 're not helping africa what about africa 's population the population is n't out of proportion to its area but africa leads the world in deaths from often preventable causes malnutrition simple infections and birth complications then there 's hivaids and then there are deaths from war ok currently there are 45,000 people a month dying in the congo as a consequence of the war there over coltan and diamonds and other things it 's still going on what about africa 's capacity to do something about these problems well here 's the number of physicians in africa here 's the number of people in higher education and here [UNK] most shocking to me [UNK] the number of scientific research papers coming out of africa it just does n't exist scientifically and this was very eloquently argued at ted africa that all of the aid that 's been given has completely failed to put africa onto its own two feet well the transition to democracy in south africa in 1994 was literally a dream come true for many of us my parents were both elected to the first parliament alongside nelson and winnie mandela they were the only other couple and in 2001 i took a research leave to visit them and while i was busy working [UNK] i was working on these colliding worlds in the day but i learned that there was a desperate shortage of skills especially mathematical skills in industry in government in education the ability to make and test models has become essential not only to every single area of science today but also to modern society itself and if you do n't have math you 're not going to enter the modern age so i had an idea and the idea was very simple the idea was to set up an african institute for mathematical sciences or aims and let 's recruit students from the whole of africa bring them together with lecturers from all over the world and we 'll try to give them a fantastic education well as a cambridge professor i had many contacts and to my astonishment they backed me 100 percent they said " go and do it and we 'll come and lecture " and i knew it would be amazing fun to bring brilliant students from these countries [UNK] where they do n't have any opportunities [UNK] together with the best lecturers in the world [UNK] who i knew would come because of the interest in africa [UNK] and put them together and just let the sparks fly so we bought a derelict hotel near cape town it 's an 80-room art deco hotel from the 1920s the area was kind of seedy so we got an 80-room hotel for 100,000 dollars it 's a beautiful building we decided we would refurbish it and then put out the word we 're going to start the best math institute in africa in this hotel well the new south africa is a very exciting country and those of you who have n't been there you should go it 's very very interesting what 's happening and we recruited wonderful staff highly motivated staff the other thing that 's happened which was good for us is the internet even though the internet is very expensive all over africa there are internet cafes everywhere and bright young africans are desperate to join the global community to be successful [UNK] and they 're very ambitious they want to be the next einstein and so when word came out that aims was opening it spread very quickly via e-mail and our website and we got lots of applicants well we designed aims as a 24-hour learning environment and it was fantastic to start a university from the beginning you have to rethink what is the university for and that 's really exciting so we designed it to have interactive teaching no droning on at the chalkboard we emphasize problem-solving working in groups every student discovering and maximizing their own potential and not chasing grades everyone lives together in this hotel [UNK] lecturers and students [UNK] and it 's not surprising at all to find an impromptu tutorial at 1 a.m the students do n't usually leave the computer lab till 2 or 3 a.m and then they 're up again at eight in the morning lectures problem-solving and so on it 's an extraordinary place we especially emphasize areas of great relevance to africa 's development because in those areas scientists working in africa will have a competitive advantage they 'll publish be invited to conferences they 'll do well they 'll have successful careers and aims has done extremely well here is a list of last year 's graduates graduated in june and what they 're currently doing [UNK] 48 of them and where they are is indicated over here and where they 've gone so these are all postgraduate students and they 've all gone on to master 's and ph.d. degrees in excellent places five students can be educated at aims for the cost of educating one in the u.s. or europe but more important the pan-african student body is a continual source of strength pride and commitment to africa we illustrate aims ' progress by coloring in the countries of africa so here you can see behind this list when a county is colored yellow we 've received an application orange we 've accepted an application and green a student has graduated so here is where we were after the first graduation in 2004 and we set ourselves a goal of turning the continent green so there 's 2005 -6 -7 -8 we 're well on the way to achieving our initial goal we had some of the students filmed at home before they came to aims and i 'll just show you one tendai mugwagwa my name is tendai mugwagwa i have a bachelor of science with an education degree i will be attending aims my understanding of the course is that it covers quite a lot you know from physics to medicine in particular epidemiology and also mathematical modeling neil turok so tendai came to aims and did very well and i 'll let her take it from there tm my name is tendai mugwagwa and i was a student at aims in 2003 and 2004 after leaving aims i went on to do a master 's in applied mathematics at the university of cape town in south africa after that i came to the netherlands where i 'm now doing a ph.d. in theoretical immunology professor tendai is working very independently she communicates well with the immunologists at the hospital so all in all i have a very good ph.d. student from south africa so i 'm happy she 's here nt another student in the first year of aims was shehu and he 's shown here with his favorite high school teacher and then entering university in northern nigeria and after aims shehu wanted to do high-energy physics and he came to cambridge he 's about to finish his ph.d. and he was filmed recently with someone you all know shehu and from there we will be able to hopefully make better predictions and then we compare it to the graph and also make some predictions stephen hawking that is nice nt here are the current students at aims there are 53 of them from 20 different countries including 20 women so now i 'm going to get to my ted business well we had a party this is africa [UNK] we have good parties in africa and last month they threw a surprise party for me here 's somebody you 've seen already i want to point out a few other exceptional people in this picture so we were having a party as you can see they 're completely eclipsing me at this point this is ezra she 's from darfur she 's a physicist and somehow stays smiling in spite of everything going on back home but she wants to continue in physics and she 's doing extremely well this is lydia lydia is the first ever woman to graduate in mathematics in the central african republic and she 's now at aims so now let me get to our ted wish well it 's not my ted wish it 's our wish as you 've already gathered and our wish has two parts one is a dream and the other 's a plan ok our ted dream is that the next einstein will be african in striving for the heights of creative genius we want to give thousands of people the motivation the encouragement and the courage to obtain the high-level skills they need to help africa among them will be not only brilliant scientists [UNK] i 'm sure of that from what we 've seen at aims [UNK] they 'll also be the african gates brins and pages of the future well i said we also have a plan and our plan is quite simple aims is now a proven model and what we need to do is to replicate it we want to roll out 15 aims centers in the next five years all over africa each will have a pan-african student body but specialize in a different area of science we want to use science to overcome the national and cultural barriers as it does at aims and we want to add elements to the curriculum we want to add entrepreneurship and policy skills the expanded aims will be a coherent pan-african institution and its graduates will form a powerful network working together for peace and progress across the continent over the last year we 've been visiting sites in africa looking at potential sites for new aims centers and here are the ones we 've selected and each of these centers has a strong local team each is in a beautiful place an interesting place which international lecturers will be happy to visit and our partners across africa are extremely enthusiastic about this everyone wants an aims center in their country and last november the conference of all the african ministers of science and technology held in mombasa called for a comprehensive plan to roll out aims so we have political support right across the continent it wo n't be easy at every site there will be huge challenges local scientists must play leading roles and governments must be persuaded to buy in conditions are very difficult but we can not afford to compromise on those principles which made aims work and we summarize them this way the institutes have got to be relevant innovative cost-effective and high quality why because we want africa to be rich easy to remember the basic rules we need so just in ending let me say the only people who can fix africa are talented young africans by unlocking and nurturing their creative potential we can create a step change in africa 's future over time they will contribute to african development and to science in ways we can only imagine thank you .i just want to say over the last few years i 've been [UNK] had the opportunity to do this closing conference and i 've had some incredible warm-up acts about eight years ago billy graham opened for me and i thought that there was [UNK] i thought that there was absolutely no way in hell to top that but i just wanted to say [UNK] and i mean this without irony [UNK] i think i can speak for everybody in the audience when i say that i wish to god that you were the president of the united states ok this is the title of my talk today i just want to give you a quick overview first of all please remember i 'm completely politically correct and i mean everything with great affection if any of you have sensitive stomachs or are feeling queasy now is the time to check your blackberry just to review this is my tedtalk we 're going to do some jokes some gags some little skits [UNK] and then we 're going to talk about the l1 point so one of the questions i ask myself is was this the most distressing ted ever let 's try and sum things up shall we images of limb regeneration and faces filled with smallpox 21 percent of the conference mentions of polar bears drowning four percent images of the earth being wiped out by flood or bird flu 64 percent and david pogue singing show tunes because this is the most distressing ted ever i 've been working with neil gershenfeld on next year 's ted bag and if the [UNK] if the conference is anywhere near this distressing then we 're going to have a scream bag next year it 's going to be a cradle-to-cradle scream bag of course so you 're going to be able to go like this bring it over here and open it up aaaah 1 meanwhile back at ted university this wonderful woman is teaching you how to chop sun chips so robert wright [UNK] i do n't know i felt like if there was anyone that helen needed to give antidepressants to it might have been him i want to deliberately interfere with his dopamine levels he was talking about morality economy class morality is we want to bomb you back to the stone age business class morality is do n't bomb japan [UNK] they built my car and first-class morality is do n't bomb mexico [UNK] they clean my house yes it is politically incorrect all right now i want to do a little bit of a thing for you 1 all right now these are the wha [UNK] i 'd say [ mumble mumble [UNK] mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble ] [UNK] ahh 1 so i wanted to show you guys [UNK] i wanted to talk about a revolutionary new computer interface that lets you work with images just as easily as you [UNK] as a completely natural user interface and you can [UNK] you can use really natural hand gestures to like go like this now we had a harvard professor here [UNK] she was from harvard i just wanted to mention and [UNK] and she was actually a professor from harvard and she was talking about seven-dimensional inverted universes with you know of course there 's the gravity brain there 's the weak brain and then there 's my weak brain which is too [UNK] too [UNK] absolutely too weak to understand what the fuck she was talking about now [UNK] one of the things that is very important to me is to try and figure out what on earth am i here for and that 's why i went out and i picked up a best-selling business book you know it basically uses as its central premise greek mythology and it 's by a guy named pastor rick warren and it 's called " the porpoise driven life " and rick is as a pagan god which i thought was kind of appropriate in a certain way and now we 're going to have kind of a little more visualization about rick warren ok. all right now red is rick warren and green is daniel dennett ok the scales here are religiosity from zero percent or atheist to 100 percent bible literally true and then this is books sold [UNK] the logarithmic scale 30,000 300,000 three million 30 million 300 million ok now they 're duking it out now they 're duking it out and rick warren 's kind of pulling ahead kind of pulling ahead yup and his installed base is getting a little bigger but darwin 's dangerous idea is coming back it 's coming back let me turn the trails on so you can see that a little bit better now one of the things that 's very important is nicholas negroponte talked to us about one lap dance per [UNK] i 'm sorry [UNK] about one laptop per child now let 's talk about some of the characteristics that are important for this revolutionary device i 'll tell you a little bit about the design parameters and then i 'll show it to you in person first of all it needs to be small it needs to be flat so it 's transportable lightweight portable uses very very little power very very high resolution has to be visible in bright daylight will work anywhere and broadly applicable across many platforms now we 've actually done some research [UNK] neil gershenfeld and the fab labs went out into the market they did some research we came back and we think we have the perfect prototype of what the students in the field are actually asking for and here it is the $ 100 computer ok ok ok ok [UNK] excellent excellent now i bought this device from clifford stoll for about 900 bucks and he and his team of junior-high school students were doing real science so we 're trying to check and trying to douse here and see who uses marijuana see who uses marijuana are we going to be able to find any marijuana jim young only if we open enough locker doors ok now smallpox is an extremely distressing illness we had dr. larry brilliant talking about how we eradicated smallpox i wanted to show you the stages of smallpox we start this is day one day two day three she gets a massively big pox on her shoulder day three day four day five and day six now the good news is because i 'm a trained medical professional i know that even though she 'll be scarred for life she 's going to make a full recovery now the good news about architects for humanity is they 're really kind of the most amazing group they 've been sponsoring a design competition to come up with innovative medical housing solutions clinic solutions in africa and they 've had a design competition now the wonderful thing is larry brilliant was just appointed the head of the google foundation and so he decided that he would support [UNK] he would support cameron 's work and the way he decided to support that work was by shipping over 50,000 shipping containers of google snacks so i want to show you some prototypes the u.n. [UNK] you know they took 20 years just to add a flap to a tent but i think we have some more exciting things this is a home made entirely out of fruit roll-ups and those roll-up cookies coated with white chocolate and the really wonderful thing about this is when you 're done well [UNK] you can eat it but the thing that i 'm really really excited about is this incredible granola house and the granola house has a special sun chip roof to collect water and recycle it and it 's [UNK] well on this side it has regular sour patch kids and gummy bears to let in the light but on this side it has sugary gummy bears to diffuse the light more slightly and we [UNK] we wanted just to show you what this might look like in situ so einstein [UNK] einstein tell me [UNK] what 's your favorite song no i said what 's your favorite song no i said what 's your favorite song " free bird " ok so einstein what 's your favorite singing group could you say that again what 's your favorite singing group ok one more time [UNK] i 'm just going to give you a little help your favorite singing group [UNK] it 's diana ross and the [UNK] audience supremes 1 tom reilly exactly could we have the sound up on the laptop please " free bird " kind of reminds me that if you [UNK] if you listen to " free bird " backwards this is what you might hear computer satan satan satan satan satan satan satan tr now it 's a little hard to hear the whole message so i wanted to [UNK] so i wanted to help you a little bit computer my sweet satan dan dennett worships satan buy " the purpose-driven life " or satan will take your soul tr so we 've talked a lot about global warming but you know as jill said it sounds kind of nice [UNK] good weather in the wintertime and new york city and as jay walker pointed out that is just not scary enough so al i actually think i 'm rather good at branding so i 've tried to figure out a good design process to come up with a new term to replace " global warming " so we started with babel fish we put in global warming and then we decided that we 'd change it from english to dutch [UNK] into " het globale verwarmen " from dutch to chinese into " hordahordaneecheewa " chinese to portuguese aquecer-se global then portuguese to pig latin aquecer-se ucked-fay and then finally back into the english which is we 're totally fucked now i do n't know about you but michael shermer talked about the willingness for human beings [UNK] evolutionarily they 're designed to see patterns in things for example in cheese sandwiches now can you look at that carefully and see if you see the virgin mary i tried to make it a little bit clearer is it the virgin mary or is it mena trott so i talked to josh prince-ramus about the convention center and the conferences it 's getting awfully big it 's getting just a little bit too big it 's bursting at the seams here a little bit so we tried to come up with a program [UNK] how we could remake this structure to better accommodate ted so first of all we decided [UNK] that we needed about one-third bookstore one-third google cafe about 20 percent registration 80 percent luxury hotel about five percent for restrooms and then of course we wanted to have the simulcast lounge the lobby and the steinbeck forum now let me show you how that literally translated into the design program so first one of the problems with monterey is that if there is global warming and greenland melts as you say the ocean level is going to rise 20 feet and flood the hell out of the convention center so we 're going to build this new building on stilts so we build this building on stilts then up here [UNK] is where we 're going to put the new steinbeck auditorium and the wonderful thing about the new bookstore is it 's going to be shaped in a spiral that 's organized by the dewey decimal system then we 're going to make an escalator that helps you get up there and finally we 're going to put the marriott hotel and the portola plaza on the top now i do n't know about you but sometimes i have these images in my head of separated at birth i do n't know about you but when i see aubrey de grey i immediately go to gandalf the grey ok. now we 've heard of course that we 're all soldiers here so what i 'd really really like you to do now is pick up your white piece of paper does everybody have their white piece of paper and i want you to get out a pen and i want you to write a terrorist note if we put up the elmo for a moment [UNK] if we put up the elmo then we 'll get you know i 'll give you a model that you can work from ok and then i want you to fold that note into a paper airplane and once you 've folded it into a paper airplane i want you to take some anthrax [UNK] and i want you to put that in the paper airplane and then i want you to throw it on jim young luckily i was the recipient of the ted prize this year and i wanted to see [UNK] i want to dedicate this film to my father homer ok. now this film is n't really hard enough so i wanted to make it a little bit harder so i 'm going to try and do this while reciting pi 3.1415 2657 753 8567 24972 [UNK] [UNK] 85871 25871 3928 5657 2592 5624 can we cue the music please now i wanted to use this talk to talk about global warming a little bit back in 1968 you can see that the mountain range of brokeback mountain was covered in 151 inches of snow pack parenthetically over there on the slopes i did want to show you that black men ski but over the years 10 years later the snow packs eroded and if you notice the trees have started turning yellow the water level of the lake has started drying up a few years later there 's no snow left at all and all the trees have turned brown this year unfortunately the lakebed 's turned into an absolute cracked dry bed and i fear if we do nothing for our planet in 20 years it 's going to look like this mr. vice president i wish i knew how to quit you thank you very much .hello 1 my name is golan levin i 'm an artist and an engineer which is increasingly a more common kind of hybrid but i still fall into this weird crack where people do n't seem to understand me and i was looking around and i found this wonderful picture it 's a letter from " artforum " in 1967 saying " we ca n't imagine ever doing a special issue on electronics or computers in art " and they still have n't and lest you think that you all as the digerati are more enlightened i went to the apple iphone app store the other day where 's art i got productivity i got sports and somehow the idea that one would want to make art for the iphone which my friends and i are doing now is still not reflected in our understanding of what computers are for so from both directions there is kind of i think a lack of understanding about what it could mean to be an artist who uses the materials of his own day or her own day which i think artists are obliged to do is to really explore the expressive potential of the new tools that we have in my own case i 'm an artist and i 'm really interested in expanding the vocabulary of human action and basically empowering people through interactivity i want people to discover themselves as actors as creative actors by having interactive experiences a lot of my work is about trying to get away from this this a photograph of the desktop of a student of mine and when i say desktop i do n't just mean the actual desk where his mouse has worn away the surface of the desk if you look carefully you can even see a hint of the apple menu up here in the upper left where the virtual world has literally punched through to the physical so this is as joy mountford once said " the mouse is probably the narrowest straw you could try to suck all of human expression through " and the thing i 'm really trying to do is enabling people to have more rich kinds of interactive experiences how can we get away from the mouse and use our full bodies as a way of exploring aesthetic experiences not necessarily utilitarian ones so i write software and that 's how i do it and a lot of my experiences resemble mirrors in some way because this is in some sense the first way that people discover their own potential as actors and discover their own agency by saying " who is that person in the mirror oh it 's actually me " and so to give an example this is a project from last year which is called the interstitial fragment processor and it allows people to explore the negative shapes that they create when they 're just going about their everyday business so as people make shapes with their hands or their heads and so forth or with each other these shapes literally produce sounds and drop out of thin air [UNK] basically taking what 's often this kind of unseen space or this undetected space and making it something real that people then can appreciate and become creative with so again people discover their creative agency in this way and their own personalities come out in totally unique ways so in addition to using full-body input something that i 've explored now for a while has been the use of the voice which is an immensely expressive system for us vocalizing song is one of our oldest ways of making ourselves heard and understood and i came across this fantastic research by wolfgang köhler the so-called father of gestalt psychology from 1927 who submitted to an audience like yourselves the following two shapes and he said one of them is called maluma and one of them is called taketa which is which anyone want to hazard a guess maluma is on top yeah so as he says here most people answer without any hesitation so what we 're really seeing here is a phenomenon called phonaesthesia which is a kind of synesthesia that all of you have and so whereas dr. oliver sacks has talked about how perhaps one person in a million actually has true synesthesia where they hear colors or taste shapes and things like this phonaesthesia is something we can all experience to some extent it 's about mappings between different perceptual domains like hardness sharpness brightness and darkness and the phonemes that we 're able to speak with so 70 years on there 's been some research where cognitive psychologists have actually sussed out the extent to which you know l m and b are more associated with shapes that look like this and p t and k are perhaps more associated with shapes like this and here we suddenly begin to have a mapping between curvature that we can exploit numerically a relative mapping between curvature and shape so it occurred to me what happens if we could run these backwards and thus was born the project called remark which is a collaboration with zachary lieberman and the ars electronica futurelab and this is an interactive installation which presents the fiction that speech casts visible shadows so the idea is you step into a kind of a magic light and as you do you see the shadows of your own speech and they sort of fly away out of your head if a computer speech recognition system is able to recognize what you 're saying then it spells it out and if it is n't then it produces a shape which is very phonaesthetically tightly coupled to the sounds you made so let 's bring up a video of that thanks so and this project here i was working with the great abstract vocalist jaap blonk and he is a world expert in performing " the ursonate " which is a half-an-hour nonsense poem by kurt schwitters written in the 1920s which is half an hour of very highly patterned nonsense and it 's almost impossible to perform but jaap is one of the world experts in performing it and in this project we 've developed a form of intelligent real-time subtitles so these are our live subtitles that are being produced by a computer that knows the text of " the ursonate " [UNK] fortunately jaap does too very well [UNK] and it is delivering that text at the same time as jaap is so all the text you 're going to see is real-time generated by the computer visualizing what he 's doing with his voice here you can see the set-up where there is a screen with the subtitles behind him okay so 1 the full videos are online if you are interested i got a split reaction to that during the live performance because there is some people who understand live subtitles are a kind of an oxymoron because usually there is someone making them afterwards and then a bunch of people who were like " what 's the big deal i see subtitles all the time on television " you know they do n't imagine the person in the booth typing it all so in addition to the full body and in addition to the voice another thing that i 've been really interested in most recently is the use of the eyes or the gaze in terms of how people relate to each other it 's a really profound amount of nonverbal information that 's communicated with the eyes and it 's one of the most interesting technical challenges that 's very currently active in the computer sciences being able to have a camera that can understand from a fairly big distance away how these little tiny balls are actually pointing in one way or another to reveal what you 're interested in and where your attention is directed so there is a lot of emotional communication that happens there and so i 've been beginning with a variety of different projects to understand how people can relate to machines with their eyes and basically to ask the questions what if art was aware that we were looking at it how could it respond in a way to acknowledge or subvert the fact that we 're looking at it and what could it do if it could look back at us and so those are the questions that are happening in the next projects in the first one which i 'm going to show you called eyecode it 's a piece of interactive software in which if we read this little circle " the trace left by the looking of the previous observer looks at the trace left by the looking of previous observer " the idea is that it 's an image wholly constructed from its own history of being viewed by different people in an installation so let me just switch over so we can do the live demo so let 's run this and see if it works okay ah there is lots of nice bright video there is just a little test screen that shows that it 's working and what i 'm just going to do is [UNK] i 'm going to hide that and you can see here that what it 's doing is it 's recording my eyes every time i blink hello and i can 1 hello 1 okay and no matter where i am what 's really going on here is that it 's an eye-tracking system that tries to locate my eyes and if i get really far away i 'm blurry you know you 're going to have these kind of blurry spots like this that maybe only resemble eyes in a very very abstract way but if i come up really close and stare directly at the camera on this laptop then you 'll see these nice crisp eyes you can think of it as a way of sort of typing with your eyes and what you 're typing are recordings of your eyes as you 're looking at other peoples ' eyes so each person is looking at the looking of everyone else before them and this exists in larger installations where there are thousands and thousands of eyes that people could be staring at as you see who 's looking at the people looking at the people looking before them so i 'll just add a couple more blink blink and you can see just once again how it 's sort of finding my eyes and doing its best to estimate when it 's blinking alright let 's leave that so that 's this kind of recursive observation system thank you the last couple pieces i 'm going to show are basically in the new realm of robotics [UNK] for me new for me it 's called opto-isolator and i 'm going to show a video of the older version of it which is just a minute long okay in this case the opto-isolator is blinking in response to one 's own blinks so it blinks one second after you do this is a device which is intended to reduce the phenomenon of gaze down to the simplest possible materials just one eye looking at you and eliminating everything else about a face but just to consider gaze in an isolated way as a kind of as an element and at the same time it attempts to engage in what you might call familiar psycho-social gaze behaviors like looking away if you look at it too long because it gets shy or things like that okay so the last project i 'm going to show is this new one called snout it 's an eight-foot snout with a googly eye and inside it 's got an 800-pound robot arm that i borrowed from a friend it helps to have good friends i 'm at carnegie mellon we 've got a great robotics institute there i 'd like to show you thing called snout which is [UNK] the idea behind this project is to make a robot that appears as if it 's continually surprised to see you the idea is that basically [UNK] if it 's constantly like " huh 1 huh " that 's why its other name is doubletaker taker of doubles it 's always kind of doing a double take " what " and the idea is basically can it look at you and make you feel as if like " what is it my shoes " " got something on my hair " here we go alright checking him out 1 for you nerds here 's a little behind-the-scenes it 's got a computer vision system and it tries to look at the people who are moving around the most those are its targets up there is the skeleton which is actually what it 's trying to do it 's really about trying to create a novel body language for a new creature hollywood does this all the time of course but also have the body language communicate something to the person who is looking at it this language is communicating that it is surprised to see you and it 's interested in looking at you thank you very much that 's all i 've got for today and i 'm really happy to be here thank you so much .so i was privileged to train in transplantation under two great surgical pioneers thomas starzl who performed the world 's first successful liver transplant in 1967 and sir roy calne who performed the first liver transplant in the u.k. in the following year i returned to singapore and in 1990 performed asia 's first successful cadaveric liver transplant procedure but against all odds now when i look back the transplant was actually the easiest part next raising the money to fund the procedure but perhaps the most challenging part was to convince the regulators [UNK] a matter which was debated in the parliament [UNK] that a young female surgeon be allowed the opportunity to pioneer for her country but 20 years on my patient surinder is asia 's longest surviving cadaveric liver transplant to date and perhaps more important i am the proud godmother to her 14 year-old son but not all patients on the transplant wait list are so fortunate the truth is there are just simply not enough donor organs to go around as the demand for donor organs continues to rise in large part due to the aging population the supply has remained relatively constant in the united states alone 100,000 men women and children are on the waiting list for donor organs and more than a dozen die each day because of a lack of donor organs the transplant community has actively campaigned in organ donation and the gift of life has been extended from brain-dead donors to living related donors [UNK] relatives who might donate an organ or a part of an organ like a split liver graft to a relative or loved one but as there was still a dire shortage of donor organs the gift of life was then extended from living related donors to now living unrelated donors and this then has given rise to unprecedented and unexpected moral controversy how can one distinguish a donation that is voluntary and altruistic from one that is forced or coerced from for example a submissive spouse an in-law a servant a slave an employee where and how can we draw the line in my part of the world too many people live below the poverty line and in some areas the commercial gifting of an organ in exchange for monetary reward has led to a flourishing trade in living unrelated donors shortly after i performed the first liver transplant i received my next assignment and that was to go to the prisons to harvest organs from executed prisoners i was also pregnant at the time pregnancies are meant to be happy and fulfilling moments in any woman 's life but my joyful period was marred by solemn and morbid thoughts [UNK] thoughts of walking through the prison 's high-security death row as this was the only route to take me to the makeshift operating room and at each time i would feel the chilling stares of condemned prisoners ' eyes follow me and for two years i struggled with the dilemma of waking up at 430 am on a friday morning driving to the prison getting down gloved and scrubbed ready to receive the body of an executed prisoner remove the organs and then transport these organs to the recipient hospital and then graft the gift of life to a recipient the same afternoon no doubt i was informed the consent had been obtained but in my life the one fulfilling skill that i had was now invoking feelings of conflict [UNK] conflict ranging from extreme sorrow and doubt at dawn to celebratory joy at engrafting the gift of life at dusk in my team the lives of one or two of my colleagues were tainted by this experience some of us may have been sublimated but really none of us remained the same i was troubled that the retrieval of organs from executed prisoners was at least as morally controversial as the harvesting of stem cells from human embryos and in my mind i realized as a surgical pioneer that the purpose of my position of influence was surely to speak up for those who have no influence it made me wonder if there could be a better way [UNK] a way to circumvent death and yet deliver the gift of life that might exponentially impact millions of patients worldwide now just about that time the practice of surgery evolved from big to small from wide open incisions to keyhole procedures tiny incisions and in transplantation concepts shifted from whole organs to cells in 1988 at the university of minnesota i participated in a small series of whole organ pancreas transplants i witnessed the technical difficulty and this inspired in my mind a shift from transplanting whole organs to perhaps transplanting cells i thought to myself why not take the individual cells out of the pancreas [UNK] the cells that secrete insulin to cure diabetes [UNK] and transplant these cells [UNK] technically a much simpler procedure than having to grapple with the complexities of transplanting a whole organ and at that time stem cell research had gained momentum following the isolation of the world 's first human embryonic stem cells in the 1990s the observation that stem cells as master cells could give rise to a whole variety of different cell types [UNK] heart cells liver cells pancreatic islet cells [UNK] captured the attention of the media and the imagination of the public i too was fascinated by this new and disruptive cell technology and this inspired a shift in my mindset from transplanting whole organs to transplanting cells and i focused my research on stem cells as a possible source for cell transplants today we realize that there are many different types of stem cells embryonic stem cells have occupied center stage chiefly because of their pluripotency [UNK] that is their ease in differentiating into a variety of different cell types but the moral controversy surrounding embryonic stem cells [UNK] the fact that these cells are derived from five-day old human embryos [UNK] has encouraged research into other types of stem cells now to the ridicule of my colleagues i inspired my lab to focus on what i thought was the most non-controversial source of stem cells adipose tissue or fat yes fat [UNK] nowadays available in abundant supply [UNK] you and i i think would be very happy to get rid of anyway fat-derived stem cells are adult stem cells and adult stem cells are found in you and me [UNK] in our blood in our bone marrow in our fat our skin and other organs and as it turns out fat is one of the best sources of adult stem cells but adult stem cells are not embryonic stem cells and here is the limitation adult stem cells are mature cells and like mature human beings these cells are more restricted in their thought and more restricted in their behavior and are unable to give rise to the wide variety of specialized cell types as embryonic stem cells [ can ] but in 2007 two remarkable individuals shinya yamanaka of japan and jamie thomson of the united states made an astounding discovery they discovered that adult cells taken from you and me could be reprogrammed back into embryonic-like cells which they termed ips cells or induced pluripotent stem cells and so guess what scientists around the world and in the labs are racing to convert aging adult cells [UNK] aging adult cells from you and me [UNK] they are racing to reprogram these cells back into more useful ips cells and in our lab we are focused on taking fat and reprogramming mounds of fat into fountains of youthful cells [UNK] cells that we may use to then form other more specialized cells which one day may be used as cell transplants if this research is successful it may then reduce the need to research and sacrifice human embryos indeed there is a lot of hype but also hope that the promise of stem cells will one day provide cures for a whole range of conditions heart disease stroke diabetes spinal cord injury muscular dystrophy retinal eye diseases [UNK] are any of these conditions relevant personally to you in may 2006 something horrible happened to me i was about to start a robotic operation but stepping out of the elevator into the bright and glaring lights of the operating room i realized that my left visual field was fast collapsing into darkness earlier that week i had taken a rather hard knock during late spring skiing [UNK] yes i fell and i started to see floaters and stars which i casually dismissed as too much high-altitude sun exposure what happened to me might have been catastrophic if not for the fact that i was in reach of good surgical access and i had my vision restored but not before a prolonged period of convalescence [UNK] three months [UNK] in a head down position this experience taught me to empathize more with my patients and especially those with retinal diseases 37 million people worldwide are blind and 127 million more suffer from impaired vision stem cell-derived retinal transplants now in a research phase may one day restore vision or part vision to millions of patients with retinal diseases worldwide indeed we live in both challenging as well as exciting times as the world population ages scientists are racing to discover new ways to enhance the power of the body to heal itself through stem cells it is a fact that when our organs or tissues are injured our bone marrow releases stem cells into our circulation and these stem cells then float in the bloodstream and hone in to damaged organs to release growth factors to repair the damaged tissue stem cells may be used as building blocks to repair damaged scaffolds within our body or to provide new liver cells to repair damaged liver as we speak there are 117 or so clinical trials researching the use of stem cells for liver diseases what lies ahead heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide 1.1 million americans suffer heart attacks yearly 4.8 million suffer cardiac failure stem cells may be used to deliver growth factors to repair damaged heart muscle or be differentiated into heart muscle cells to restore heart function there are 170 clinical trials investigating the role of stem cells in heart disease while still in a research phase stem cells may one day herald a quantum leap in the field of cardiology stem cells provide hope for new beginnings [UNK] small incremental steps cells rather than organs repair rather than replacement stem cell therapies may one day reduce the need for donor organs powerful new technologies always present enigmas as we speak the world 's first human embryonic stem cell trial for spinal cord injury is currently underway following the usfda approval and in the u.k. neural stem cells to treat stroke are being investigated in a phase one trial the research success that we celebrate today has been made possible by the curiosity and contribution and commitment of individual scientists and medical pioneers each one has his story my story has been about my journey from organs to cells [UNK] a journey through controversy inspired by hope [UNK] hope that as we age you and i may one day celebrate longevity with an improved quality of life thank you .on the 30th of may 1832 a gunshot was heard ringing out across the 13th arrondissement in paris a peasant who was walking to market that morning ran towards where the gunshot had come from and found a young man writhing in agony on the floor clearly shot by a dueling wound the young man 's name was evariste galois he was a well-known revolutionary in paris at the time galois was taken to the local hospital where he died the next day in the arms of his brother and the last words he said to his brother were " do n't cry for me alfred i need all the courage i can muster to die at the age of 20 " it was n't in fact revolutionary politics for which galois was famous but a few years earlier while still at school he 'd actually cracked one of the big mathematical problems at the time and he wrote to the academicians in paris trying to explain his theory but the academicians could n't understand anything that he wrote this is how he wrote most of his mathematics so the night before that duel he realized this possibly is his last chance to try and explain his great breakthrough so he stayed up the whole night writing away trying to explain his ideas and as the dawn came up and he went to meet his destiny he left this pile of papers on the table for the next generation maybe the fact that he stayed up all night doing mathematics was the fact that he was such a bad shot that morning and got killed but contained inside those documents was a new language a language to understand one of the most fundamental concepts of science [UNK] namely symmetry now symmetry is almost nature 's language it helps us to understand so many different bits of the scientific world for example molecular structure what crystals are possible we can understand through the mathematics of symmetry in microbiology you really do n't want to get a symmetrical object because they are generally rather nasty the swine flu virus at the moment is a symmetrical object and it uses the efficiency of symmetry to be able to propagate itself so well but on a larger scale of biology actually symmetry is very important because it actually communicates genetic information i 've taken two pictures here and i 've made them artificially symmetrical and if i ask you which of these you find more beautiful you 're probably drawn to the lower two because it is hard to make symmetry and if you can make yourself symmetrical you 're sending out a sign that you 've got good genes you 've got a good upbringing and therefore you 'll make a good mate so symmetry is a language which can help to communicate genetic information symmetry can also help us to explain what 's happening in the large hadron collider in cern or what 's not happening in the large hadron collider in cern to be able to make predictions about the fundamental particles we might see there it seems that they are all facets of some strange symmetrical shape in a higher dimensional space and i think galileo summed up very nicely the power of mathematics to understand the scientific world around us he wrote " the universe can not be read until we have learnt the language and become familiar with the characters in which it is written it is written in mathematical language and the letters are triangles circles and other geometric figures without which means it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word " but it 's not just scientists who are interested in symmetry artists too love to play around with symmetry they also have a slightly more ambiguous relationship with it here is thomas mann talking about symmetry in " the magic mountain " he has a character describing the snowflake and he says he " shuddered at its perfect precision found it deathly the very marrow of death " but what artists like to do is to set up expectations of symmetry and then break them and a beautiful example of this i found actually when i visited a colleague of mine in japan professor kurokawa and he took me up to the temples in nikko and just after this photo was taken we walked up the stairs and the gateway you see behind has eight columns with beautiful symmetrical designs on them seven of them are exactly the same and the eighth one is turned upside down and i said to professor kurokawa " wow the architects must have really been kicking themselves when they realized that they 'd made a mistake and put this one upside down " and he said " no no no it was a very deliberate act " and he referred me to this lovely quote from the japanese " essays in idleness " from the 14th century in which the essayist wrote " in everything uniformity is undesirable leaving something incomplete makes it interesting and gives one the feeling that there is room for growth " even when building the imperial palace they always leave one place unfinished but if i had to choose one building in the world to be cast out on a desert island to live the rest of my life being an addict of symmetry i would probably choose the alhambra in granada this is a palace celebrating symmetry recently i took my family [UNK] we do these rather kind of nerdy mathematical trips which my family love this is my son tamer you can see he 's really enjoying our mathematical trip to the alhambra but i wanted to try and enrich him i think one of the problems about school mathematics is it does n't look at how mathematics is embedded in the world we live in so i wanted to open his eyes up to how much symmetry is running through the alhambra you see it already immediately you go in the reflective symmetry in the water but it 's on the walls where all the exciting things are happening the moorish artists were denied the possibility to draw things with souls so they explored a more geometric art and so what is symmetry the alhambra somehow asks all of these questions what is symmetry when [ there ] are two of these walls do they have the same symmetries can we say whether they discovered all of the symmetries in the alhambra and it was galois who produced a language to be able to answer some of these questions for galois symmetry [UNK] unlike for thomas mann which was something still and deathly [UNK] for galois symmetry was all about motion what can you do to a symmetrical object move it in some way so it looks the same as before you moved it i like to describe it as the magic trick moves what can you do to something you close your eyes i do something put it back down again it looks like it did before it started so for example the walls in the alhambra [UNK] i can take all of these tiles and fix them at the yellow place rotate them by 90 degrees put them all back down again and they fit perfectly down there and if you open your eyes again you would n't know that they 'd moved but it 's the motion that really characterizes the symmetry inside the alhambra but it 's also about producing a language to describe this and the power of mathematics is often to change one thing into another to change geometry into language so i 'm going to take you through perhaps push you a little bit mathematically [UNK] so brace yourselves [UNK] push you a little bit to understand how this language works which enables us to capture what is symmetry so let 's take these two symmetrical objects here let 's take the twisted six-pointed starfish what can i do to the starfish which makes it look the same well there i rotated it by a sixth of a turn and still it looks like it did before i started i could rotate it by a third of a turn or a half a turn or put it back down on its image or two thirds of a turn and a fifth symmetry i can rotate it by five sixths of a turn and those are things that i can do to the symmetrical object that make it look like it did before i started now for galois there was actually a sixth symmetry can anybody think what else i could do to this which would leave it like i did before i started i ca n't flip it because i 've put a little twist on it have n't i it 's got no reflective symmetry but what i could do is just leave it where it is pick it up and put it down again and for galois this was like the zeroth symmetry actually the invention of the number zero was a very modern concept seventh century a.d. by the indians it seems mad to talk about nothing and this is the same idea this is a symmetrical [UNK] so everything has symmetry where you just leave it where it is so this object has six symmetries and what about the triangle well i can rotate by a third of a turn clockwise or a third of a turn anticlockwise but now this has some reflectional symmetry i can reflect it in the line through x or the line through y or the line through z five symmetries and then of course the zeroth symmetry where i just pick it up and leave it where it is so both of these objects have six symmetries now i 'm a great believer that mathematics is not a spectator sport and you have to do some mathematics in order to really understand it so here is a little question for you and i 'm going to give a prize at the end of my talk for the person who gets closest to the answer the rubik 's cube how many symmetries does a rubik 's cube have how many things can i do to this object and put it down so it still looks like a cube okay so i want you to think about that problem as we go on and count how many symmetries there are and there will be a prize for the person who gets closest at the end but let 's go back down to symmetries that i got for these two objects what galois realized it is n't just the individual symmetries but how they interact with each other which really characterizes the symmetry of an object if i do one magic trick move followed by another the combination is a third magic trick move and here we see galois starting to develop a language to see the substance of the things unseen the sort of abstract idea of the symmetry underlying this physical object for example what if i turn the starfish by a sixth of a turn and then a third of a turn so i 've given names the capital letters a b c d e f are the names for the rotations b for example rotates the little yellow dot to the b on the starfish and so on so what if i do b which is a sixth of a turn followed by c which is a third of a turn well let 's do that a sixth of a turn followed by a third of a turn the combined effect is as if i had just rotated it by half a turn in one go so the little table here records how the algebra of these symmetries work i do one followed by another the answer is it 's rotation d half a turn what i if i did it in the other order would it make any difference let 's see let 's do the third of the turn first and then the sixth of a turn of course it does n't make any difference it still ends up at half a turn and there is some symmetry here in the way the symmetries interact with each other but this is completely different to the symmetries of the triangle let 's see what happens if we do two symmetries with the triangle one after the other let 's do a rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise and reflect in the line through x well the combined effect is as if i had just done the reflection in the line through z to start with now let 's do it in a different order let 's do the reflection in x first followed by the rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise the combined effect the triangle ends up somewhere completely different it 's as if it was reflected in the line through y now it matters what order you do the operations in and this enables us to distinguish why the symmetries of these objects [UNK] they both have six symmetries so why should n't we say they have the same symmetries but the way the symmetries interact enable us [UNK] we 've now got a language to distinguish why these symmetries are fundamentally different and you can try this when you go down to the pub later on take a beer mat and rotate it by a quarter of a turn then flip it and then do it in the other order and the picture will be facing in the opposite direction now galois produced some laws for how these tables [UNK] how symmetries interact it 's almost like little sudoku tables you do n't see any symmetry twice in any row or column and using those rules he was able to say that there are in fact only two objects with six symmetries and they 'll be the same as the symmetries of the triangle or the symmetries of the six-pointed starfish i think this is an amazing development it 's almost like the concept of number being developed for symmetry in the front here i 've got one two three people sitting on one two three chairs the people on the chairs are very different but the number the abstract idea of the number is the same and we can see this now we go back to the walls in the alhambra here are two very different walls very different geometric pictures but using the language of galois we can understand that the underlying abstract symmetries of these things are actually the same for example let 's take this beautiful wall with the triangles with a little twist on them you can rotate them by a sixth of a turn if you ignore the colors we 're not matching up the colors but the shapes match up if i rotate by a sixth of a turn around the point where all the triangles meet what about the center of a triangle i can rotate by a third of a turn around the center of the triangle and everything matches up and then there is an interesting place halfway along an edge where i can rotate by 180 degrees and all the tiles match up again so rotate along halfway along the edge and they all match up now let 's move to the very different-looking wall in the alhambra and we find the same symmetries here and the same interaction so there was a sixth of a turn a third of a turn where the z pieces meet and the half a turn is halfway between the six pointed stars and although these walls look very different galois has produced a language to say that in fact the symmetries underlying these are exactly the same and it 's a symmetry we call 6-3-2 here is another example in the alhambra this is a wall a ceiling and a floor they all look very different but this language allows us to say that they are representations of the same symmetrical abstract object which we call 4-4-2 nothing to do with football but because of the fact that there are two places where you can rotate by a quarter of a turn and one by half a turn now this power of the language is even more because galois can say " did the moorish artists discover all of the possible symmetries on the walls in the alhambra " and it turns out they almost did you can prove using galois ' language there are actually only 17 different symmetries that you can do in the walls in the alhambra and they if you try to produce a different wall with this 18th one it will have to have the same symmetries as one of these 17 but these are things that we can see and the power of galois ' mathematical language is it also allows us to create symmetrical objects in the unseen world beyond the two-dimensional three-dimensional all the way through to the four- or five- or infinite-dimensional space and that 's where i work i create mathematical objects symmetrical objects using galois ' language in very high dimensional spaces so i think it 's a great example of things unseen which the power of mathematical language allows you to create so like galois i stayed up all last night creating a new mathematical symmetrical object for you and i 've got a picture of it here well unfortunately it is n't really a picture if i could have my board at the side here great excellent here we are unfortunately i ca n't show you a picture of this symmetrical object but here is the language which describes how the symmetries interact now this new symmetrical object does not have a name yet now people like getting their names on things on craters on the moon or new species of animals so i 'm going to give you the chance to get your name on a new symmetrical object which has n't been named before and this thing [UNK] species die away and moons kind of get hit by meteors and explode [UNK] but this mathematical object will live forever it will make you immortal in order to win this symmetrical object what you have to do is to answer the question i asked you at the beginning how many symmetries does a rubik 's cube have okay i 'm going to sort you out rather than you all shouting out i want you to count how many digits there are in that number okay if you 've got it as a factorial you 've got to expand the factorials okay now if you want to play i want you to stand up okay if you think you 've got an estimate for how many digits right [UNK] we 've already got one competitor here if you all stay down he wins it automatically okay excellent so we 've got four here five six great excellent that should get us going all right anybody with five or less digits you 've got to sit down because you 've underestimated five or less digits so if you 're in the tens of thousands you 've got to sit down 60 digits or more you 've got to sit down you 've overestimated 20 digits or less sit down how many digits are there in your number two so you should have sat down earlier let 's have the other ones who sat down during the 20 up again okay if i told you 20 or less stand up because this one i think there were a few here the people who just last sat down okay how many digits do you have in your number 21 okay good how many do you have in yours 18 so it goes to this lady here 21 is the closest it actually has [UNK] the number of symmetries in the rubik 's cube has 25 digits so now i need to name this object so what is your name i need your surname symmetrical objects generally [UNK] spell it for me g-h-e-z no so2 has already been used actually in the mathematical language so you ca n't have that one so ghez there we go that 's your new symmetrical object you are now immortal and if you 'd like your own symmetrical object i have a project raising money for a charity in guatemala where i will stay up all night and devise an object for you for a donation to this charity to help kids get into education in guatemala and i think what drives me as a mathematician are those things which are not seen the things that we have n't discovered it 's all the unanswered questions which make mathematics a living subject and i will always come back to this quote from the japanese " essays in idleness " " in everything uniformity is undesirable leaving something incomplete makes it interesting and gives one the feeling that there is room for growth " thank you .thank you slide into the shimmering surface between two worlds standing at the center of time as it uncurls cutting through the veil of illusion moving beyond past conclusions wondering if all my doubt and confusion will clear if i could be anywhere if i could be anywhere if i could be anywhere right now i would want to be here searching for the future among the things we 're throwing away trying to see the world through the junk we produce everyday they say nothing lasts forever but all the plastic ever made is still here and no amount of closing our eyes will make it disappear if i could be anywhere if i could be anywhere if i could be anywhere in history i would want to be here the romans the spanish the british the dutch american exceptionalism so out of touch the folly of empire repeating its course imposing its will and ruling by force on and on through time but the world ca n't take it very much longer we 're not going to make it unless we 're smarter and stronger the world is going to shake itself free of our greed somehow if i could be anywhere if i could be anywhere in time if i could be anywhere and change things it would have to be now they say nothing last forever but all the plastic ever made is still here and no amount of closing our eyes will make it disappear and the world ca n't take it very much longer we 're not going to make it unless we 're smarter and stronger the world 's gon na shake itself free of our greed somehow and the world ca n't take it that you can see if the oceans do n't make it neither will we the world 's gon na shake itself all the way free somehow if i could be anywhere if i could be anywhere in time if i could be anywhere and change the outcome it would have to be now thank you .i got up this morning at 610 a.m. after going to sleep at 1245 a.m i was awakened once during the night my heart rate was 61 beats per minute [UNK] my blood pressure 127 over 74 i had zero minutes of exercise yesterday so my maximum heart rate during exercise was n't calculated i had about 600 milligrams of caffeine zero of alcohol and my score on the narcissism personality index or the npi-16 is a reassuring 0.31 we know that numbers are useful for us when we advertise manage govern search i 'm going to talk about how they 're useful when we reflect learn remember and want to improve a few years ago kevin kelly my partner and i noticed that people were subjecting themselves to regimes of quantitative measurement and self-tracking that went far beyond the ordinary familiar habits such as stepping on a scale every day people were tracking their food via twitter their kids ' diapers on their iphone they were making detailed journals of their spending their mood their symptoms their treatments now we know some of the technological facts that are driving this change in our lifestyle [UNK] the uptake and diffusion of mobile devices the exponential improvement in data storage and data processing and the remarkable improvement in human biometric sensors this little black dot there is a 3d accelerometer it tracks your movement through space it is as you can see very small and also very cheap they 're now down to well under a dollar a piece and they 're going into all kinds of devices but what 's interesting is the incredible detailed information that you can get from just one sensor like this this kind of sensor is in the hit biometric device [UNK] among early adopters at the moment [UNK] the fitbit this tracks your activity and also your sleep it has just that sensor in it you 're probably familiar with the nike system i just put it up because that little blue dot is the sensor it 's really just a pressure sensor like the kind that 's in a doorbell and nike knows how to get your pace and distance from just that sensor this is the strap that people use to transmit heart-rate data to their nike system this is a beautiful new device that gives you detailed sleep tracking data not just whether you 're asleep or awake but also your phase of sleep [UNK] deep sleep light sleep rem sleep the sensor is just a little strip of metal in that headband there the rest of it is the bedside console just for reference this is a sleep tracking system from just a few years ago [UNK] i mean really until now and this is the sleep tracking system of today this just was presented at a health care conference in d.c most of what you see there is an asthma inhaler but the top is a very small gps transceiver which gives you the date and location of an asthma incident giving you a new awareness of your vulnerability in relation to time and environmental factors now we know that new tools are changing our sense of self in the world [UNK] these tiny sensors that gather data in nature the ubiquitous computing that allows that data to be understood and used and of course the social networks that allow people to collaborate and contribute but we think of these tools as pointing outward as windows and i 'd just like to invite you to think of them as also turning inward and becoming mirrors so that when we think about using them to get some systematic improvement we also think about how they can be useful for self-improvement for self-discovery self-awareness self-knowledge here 's a biometric device a pair of apple earbuds last year apple filed some patents to get blood oxygenation heart rate and body temperature via the earbuds what is this for what should it be for some people will say it 's for biometric security some people will say it 's for public health research some people will say it 's for avant-garde marketing research i 'd like to tell you that it 's also for self-knowledge and the self is n't the only thing it 's not even most things the self is just our operation center our consciousness our moral compass so if we want to act more effectively in the world we have to get to know ourselves better thank you .now have any of y'all ever looked up this word you know in a dictionary yeah that 's what i thought how about this word here i 'll show it to you lexicography the practice of compiling dictionaries notice [UNK] we 're very specific [UNK] that word " compile " the dictionary is not carved out of a piece of granite out of a lump of rock it 's made up of lots of little bits it 's little discrete [UNK] that 's spelled d-i-s-c-r-e-t-e [UNK] bits and those bits are words now one of the perks of being a lexicographer [UNK] besides getting to come to ted [UNK] is that you get to say really fun words like lexicographical lexicographical has this great pattern it 's called a double dactyl and just by saying double dactyl i 've sent the geek needle all the way into the red but " lexicographical " is the same pattern as " higgledy-piggledy " right it 's a fun word to say and i get to say it a lot now one of the non-perks of being a lexicographer is that people do n't usually have a kind of warm fuzzy snuggly image of the dictionary right nobody hugs their dictionaries but what people really often think about the dictionary is they think more like this just to let you know i do not have a lexicographical whistle but people think that my job is to let the good words make that difficult left-hand turn into the dictionary and keep the bad words out but the thing is i do n't want to be a traffic cop for one thing i just do not do uniforms and for another deciding what words are good and what words are bad is actually not very easy and it 's not very fun and when parts of your job are not easy or fun you kind of look for an excuse not to do them so if i had to think of some kind of occupation as a metaphor for my work i would much rather be a fisherman i want to throw my big net into the deep blue ocean of english and see what marvelous creatures i can drag up from the bottom but why do people want me to direct traffic when i would much rather go fishing well i blame the queen why do i blame the queen well first of all i blame the queen because it 's funny but secondly i blame the queen because dictionaries have really not changed our idea of what a dictionary is has not changed since her reign the only thing that queen victoria would not be amused by in modern dictionaries is our inclusion of the f-word which has happened in american dictionaries since 1965 so there 's this guy right victorian era james murray first editor of the oxford english dictionary i do not have that hat i wish i had that hat so he 's really responsible for a lot of what we consider modern in dictionaries today when a guy who looks like that in that hat is the face of modernity you have a problem and so james murray could get a job on any dictionary today there 'd be virtually no learning curve and of course a few of us are saying okay computers 1 computers 1 what about computers the thing about computers is i love computers i mean i 'm a huge geek i love computers i would go on a hunger strike before i let them take away google book search from me but computers do n't do much else other than speed up the process of compiling dictionaries they do n't change the end result because what a dictionary is is it 's victorian design merged with a little bit of modern propulsion it 's steampunk what we have is an electric velocipede you know we have victorian design with an engine on it that 's all 1 the design has not changed and ok what about online dictionaries right online dictionaries must be different this is the oxford english dictionary online one of the best online dictionaries this is my favorite word by the way erinaceous pertaining to the hedgehog family of the nature of a hedgehog very useful word so look at that online dictionaries right now are paper thrown up on a screen this is flat look how many links there are in the actual entry two 1 right those little buttons i had them all expanded except for the date chart so there 's not very much going on here there 's not a lot of clickiness and in fact online dictionaries replicate almost all the problems of print except for searchability and when you improve searchability you actually take away the one advantage of print which is serendipity serendipity is when you find things you were n't looking for because finding what you are looking for is so damned difficult so [UNK] [UNK] now when you think about this what we have here is a ham butt problem does everyone know the ham butt problem woman 's making a ham for a big family dinner she goes to cut the butt off the ham and throw it away and she looks at this piece of ham and she 's like " this is a perfectly good piece of ham why am i throwing this away " she thought " well my mom always did this " so she calls up mom and she says " mom why 'd you cut the butt off the ham when you 're making a ham " she says " i do n't know my mom always did it 1 " so they call grandma and grandma says " my pan was too small 1 " so it 's not that we have good words and bad words we have a pan that 's too small 1 you know that ham butt is delicious 1 there 's no reason to throw it away the bad words [UNK] see when people think about a place and they do n't find a place on the map they think " this map sucks 1 " when they find a nightspot or a bar and it 's not in the guidebook they 're like " ooh this place must be cool 1 it 's not in the guidebook " when they find a word that 's not in the dictionary they think " this must be a bad word " why it 's more likely to be a bad dictionary why are you blaming the ham for being too big for the pan so you ca n't get a smaller ham the english language is as big as it is so if you have a ham butt problem and you 're thinking about the ham butt problem the conclusion that it leads you to is inexorable and counterintuitive paper is the enemy of words how can this be i mean i love books i really love books some of my best friends are books but the book is not the best shape for the dictionary now they 're going to think " oh boy people are going to take away my beautiful paper dictionaries " no there will still be paper dictionaries when we had cars [UNK] when cars became the dominant mode of transportation we did n't round up all the horses and shoot them you know there 're still going to be paper dictionaries but it 's not going to be the dominant dictionary the book-shaped dictionary is not going to be the only shape dictionaries come in and it 's not going to be the prototype for the shapes dictionaries come in so think about it this way if you 've got an artificial constraint artificial constraints lead to arbitrary distinctions and a skewed worldview what if biologists could only study animals that made people go " aww " right what if we made aesthetic judgments about animals and only the ones we thought were cute were the ones that we could study we 'd know a whole lot about charismatic megafauna and not very much about much else and i think this is a problem i think we should study all the words because when you think about words you can make beautiful expressions from very humble parts lexicography is really more about material science we are studying the tolerances of the materials that you use to build the structure of your expression your speeches and your writing and then often people say to me " well ok how do i know that this word is real " they think " ok if we think words are the tools that we use to build the expressions of our thoughts how can you say that screwdrivers are better than hammers how can you say that a sledgehammer is better than a ball-peen hammer " they 're just the right tools for the job and so people say to me " how do i know if a word is real " you know anybody who 's read a children 's book knows that love makes things real if you love a word use it that makes it real being in the dictionary is an artificial distinction it does n't make a word any more real than any other way if you love a word it becomes real so if we 're not worrying about directing traffic if we 've transcended paper if we are worrying less about control and more about description then we can think of the english language as being this beautiful mobile and any time one of those little parts of the mobile changes is touched any time you touch a word you use it in a new context you give it a new connotation you verb it you make the mobile move you did n't break it it 's just in a new position and that new position can be just as beautiful now if you 're no longer a traffic cop [UNK] the problem with being a traffic cop is there can only be so many traffic cops in any one intersection or the cars get confused right but if your goal is no longer to direct the traffic but maybe to count the cars that go by then more eyeballs are better you can ask for help 1 if you ask for help you get more done and we really need help library of congress 17 million books of which half are in english if only one out of every 10 of those books had a word that 's not in the dictionary in it that would be equivalent to more than two unabridged dictionaries and i find an un-dictionaried word [UNK] a word like " un-dictionaried " for example [UNK] in almost every book i read what about newspapers newspaper archive goes back to 1759 58.1 million newspaper pages if only one in 100 of those pages had an un-dictionaried word on it it would be an entire other oed that 's 500,000 more words so that 's a lot and i 'm not even talking about magazines i 'm not talking about blogs [UNK] and i find more new words on boingboing in a given week than i do newsweek or time there 's a lot going on there and i 'm not even talking about polysemy which is the greedy habit some words have of taking so if you think of the word " set " a set can be a badger 's burrow a set can be one of the pleats in an elizabethan ruff and there 's one numbered definition in the oed the oed has 33 different numbered definitions for set tiny little word 33 numbered definitions one of them is just labeled " miscellaneous technical senses " do you know what that says to me that says to me it was friday afternoon and somebody wanted to go down the pub that 's a lexicographical cop out to say " miscellaneous technical senses " so we have all these words and we really need help 1 and the thing is we could ask for help [UNK] asking for help 's not that hard i mean lexicography is not rocket science see i just gave you a lot of words and a lot of numbers and this is more of a visual explanation if we think of the dictionary as being the map of the english language these bright spots are what we know about and the dark spots are where we are in the dark if that was the map of all the words in american english we do n't know very much and we do n't even know the shape of the language if this was the dictionary [UNK] if this was the map of american english [UNK] look we have a kind of lumpy idea of florida but there 's no california 1 we 're missing california from american english we just do n't know enough and we do n't even know that we 're missing california we do n't even see that there 's a gap on the map so again lexicography is not rocket science but even if it were rocket science is being done by dedicated amateurs these days you know it ca n't be that hard to find some words 1 so enough scientists in other disciplines are really asking people to help and they 're doing a good job of it for instance there 's ebird where amateur birdwatchers can upload information about their bird sightings and then ornithologists can go and help track populations migrations etc and there 's this guy mike oates mike oates lives in the u.k he 's a director of an electroplating company he 's found more than 140 comets he 's found so many comets they named a comet after him it 's kind of out past mars it 's a hike i do n't think he 's getting his picture taken there anytime soon but he found 140 comets without a telescope he downloaded data from the nasa soho satellite and that 's how he found them if we can find comets without a telescope should n't we be able to find words now y'all know where i 'm going with this because i 'm going to the internet which is where everybody goes and the internet is great for collecting words because the internet 's full of collectors and this is a little-known technological fact about the internet but the internet is actually made up of words and enthusiasm and words and enthusiasm actually happen to be the recipe for lexicography is n't that great so there are a lot of really good word-collecting sites out there right now but the problem with some of them is that they 're not scientific enough they show the word but they do n't show any context where did it come from who said it what newspaper was it in what book because a word is like an archaeological artifact if you do n't know the provenance or the source of the artifact it 's not science it 's a pretty thing to look at so a word without its source is like a cut flower you know it 's pretty to look at for a while but then it dies it dies too fast so this whole time i 've been saying " the dictionary the dictionary the dictionary the dictionary " not " a dictionary " or " dictionaries " and that 's because well people use the dictionary to stand for the whole language they use it synecdochically and one of the problems of knowing a word like " synecdochically " is that you really want an excuse to say " synecdochically " this whole talk has just been an excuse to get me to the point where i could say " synecdochically " to all of you so i 'm really sorry but when you use a part of something [UNK] like the dictionary is a part of the language or a flag stands for the united states it 's a symbol of the country [UNK] then you 're using it synecdochically but the thing is we could make the dictionary the whole language if we get a bigger pan then we can put all the words in we can put in all the meanings does n't everyone want more meaning in their lives and we can make the dictionary not just be a symbol of the language [UNK] we can make it be the whole language you see what i 'm really hoping for is that my son who turns seven this month [UNK] i want him to barely remember that this is the form factor that dictionaries used to come in this is what dictionaries used to look like i want him to think of this kind of dictionary as an eight-track tape it 's a format that died because it was n't useful enough it was n't really what people needed and the thing is if we can put in all the words no longer have that artificial distinction between good and bad we can really describe the language like scientists we can leave the aesthetic judgments to the writers and the speakers if we can do that then i can spend all my time fishing and i do n't have to be a traffic cop anymore thank you very much for your kind attention .i 'd like to talk to you today about the scale of the scientific effort that goes into making the headlines you see in the paper headlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change and headlines that look like this when they have to do with air quality or smog they are both two branches of the same field of atmospheric science recently the headlines looked like this when the intergovernmental panel on climate change or ipcc put out their report on the state of understanding of the atmospheric system that report was written by 620 scientists from 40 countries they wrote almost a thousand pages on the topic and all of those pages were reviewed by another 400-plus scientists and reviewers from 113 countries it 's a big community it 's such a big community in fact that our annual gathering is the largest scientific meeting in the world over 15,000 scientists go to san francisco every year for that and every one of those scientists is in a research group and every research group studies a wide variety of topics for us at cambridge it 's as varied as the el niño oscillation which affects weather and climate to the assimilation of satellite data to emissions from crops that produce biofuels which is what i happen to study and in each one of these research areas of which there are even more there are phd students like me and we study incredibly narrow topics things as narrow as a few processes or a few molecules and one of the molecules i study is called isoprene which is here it 's a small organic molecule you 've probably never heard of it the weight of a paper clip is approximately equal to 900 zeta-illion [UNK] 10 to the 21st [UNK] molecules of isoprene but despite its very small weight enough of it is emitted into the atmosphere every year to equal the weight of all the people on the planet it 's a huge amount of stuff it 's equal to the weight of methane and because it 's so much stuff it 's really important for the atmospheric system because it 's important to the atmospheric system we go to all lengths to study this thing we blow it up and look at the pieces this is the euphore smog chamber in spain atmospheric explosions or full combustion takes about 15,000 times longer than what happens in your car but still we look at the pieces we run enormous models on supercomputers this is what i happen to do our models have hundreds of thousands of grid boxes calculating hundreds of variables each on minute timescales and it takes weeks to perform our integrations and we perform dozens of integrations in order to understand what 's happening we also fly all over the world looking for this thing i recently joined a field campaign in malaysia there are others we found a global atmospheric watchtower there in the middle of the rainforest and hung hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of scientific equipment off this tower to look for isoprene and of course other things while we were there this is the tower in the middle of the rainforest from above and this is the tower from below and on part of that field campaign we even brought an aircraft with us and this plane the model ba146 which was run by faam normally flies 120 to 130 people so maybe you took a similar aircraft to get here today but we did n't just fly it we were flying at 100 meters above the top of the canopy to measure this molecule [UNK] incredibly dangerous stuff we have to fly at a special incline in order to make the measurements we hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering we have to get special flight clearance and as you come around the banks in these valleys the forces can get up to two gs and the scientists have to be completely harnessed in in order to make measurements while they 're on board so as you can imagine the inside of this aircraft does n't look like any plane you would take on vacation it 's a flying laboratory that we took to make measurements in the region of this molecule we do all of this to understand the chemistry of one molecule and when one student like me has some sort of inclination or understanding about that molecule they write one scientific paper on the subject and out of that field campaign we 'll probably get a few dozen papers on a few dozen processes or molecules and as a body of knowledge builds up it will form one subsection or one sub-subsection of an assessment like the ipcc although we have others and each one of the 11 chapters of the ipcc has six to ten subsections so you can imagine the scale of the effort in each one of those assessments that we write we always tag on a summary and the summary is written for a non-scientific audience and we hand that summary to journalists and policy makers in order to make headlines like these thank you very much .thank you so much i 'm going to try to take you on a journey of the underwater acoustic world of whales and dolphins since we are such a visual species it 's hard for us to really understand this so i 'll use a mixture of figures and sounds and hope this can communicate it but let 's also think as a visual species what it 's like when we go snorkeling or diving and try to look underwater we really ca n't see very far our vision which works so well in air all of a sudden is very restricted and claustrophobic and what marine mammals have evolved over the last tens of millions of years is ways to depend on sound to both explore their world and also to stay in touch with one another dolphins and toothed whales use echolocation they can produce loud clicks and listen for echoes from the sea floor in order to orient they can listen for echoes from prey in order to decide where food is and to decide which one they want to eat all marine mammals use sound for communication to stay in touch so the large baleen whales will produce long beautiful songs which are used in reproductive advertisement for male and females both to find one another and to select a mate and mother and young and closely bonded animals use calls to stay in touch with one another so sound is really critical for their lives the first thing that got me interested in the sounds of these underwater animals whose world was so foreign to me was evidence from captive dolphins that captive dolphins could imitate human sounds and i mentioned i 'll use some visual representations of sounds here 's the first example this is a plot of frequency against time [UNK] sort of like musical notation where the higher notes are up higher and the lower notes are lower and time goes this way this is a picture of a trainer 's whistle a whistle a trainer will blow to tell a dolphin it 's done the right thing and can come get a fish it sounds sort of like " tweeeeeet " like that this is a calf in captivity making an imitation of that trainer 's whistle if you hummed this tune to your dog or cat and it hummed it back to you you ought to be pretty surprised very few nonhuman mammals can imitate sounds it 's really important for our music and our language so it 's a puzzle the few other mammal groups that do this why do they do it a lot of my career has been devoted to trying to understand how these animals use their learning use the ability to change what you say based on what you hear in their own communication systems so let 's start with calls of a nonhuman primate many mammals have to produce contact calls when say a mother and calf are apart this is an example of a call produced by squirrel monkeys when they 're isolated from another one and you can see there 's not much variability in these calls by contrast the signature whistle which dolphins use to stay in touch each individual here has a radically different call they can use this ability to learn calls in order to develop more complicated and more distinctive calls to identify individuals how about the setting in which animals need to use this call well let 's look at mothers and calves in normal life for mother and calf dolphin they 'll often drift apart or swim apart if mom is chasing a fish and when they separate they have to get back together again what this figure shows is the percentage of the separations in which dolphins whistle against the maximum distance so when dolphins are separating by less than 20 meters less than half the time they need to use whistles most of the time they can just find each other just by swimming around but all of the time when they separate by more than 100 meters they need to use these individually distinctive whistles to come back together again most of these distinctive signature whistles are quite stereotyped and stable through the life of a dolphin but there are some exceptions when a male dolphin leaves mom it will often join up with another male and form an alliance which may last for decades as these two animals form a social bond their distinctive whistles actually converge and become very similar this plot shows two members of a pair as you can see at the top here they share an up-sweep like " woop woop woop " they both have that kind of up-sweep whereas these members of a pair go " wo-ot wo-ot wo-ot " and what 's happened is they 've used this learning process to develop a new sign that identifies this new social group it 's a very interesting way that they can form a new identifier for the new social group that they 've had let 's now take a step back and see what this message can tell us about protecting dolphins from human disturbance anybody looking at this picture will know this dolphin is surrounded and clearly his behavior is being disrupted this is a bad situation but it turns out that when just a single boat is approaching a group of dolphins at a couple hundred meters away the dolphins will start whistling they 'll change what they 're doing they 'll have a more cohesive group wait for the boat to go by and then they 'll get back to normal business well in a place like sarasota florida the average interval between times that a boat is passing within a hundred meters of a dolphin group is six minutes so even in the situation that does n't look as bad as this it 's still affecting the amount of time these animals have to do their normal work and if we look at a very pristine environment like western australia lars bider has done work comparing dolphin behavior and distribution before there were dolphin-watching boats when there was one boat not much of an impact and two boats when the second boat was added what happened was that some of the dolphins left the area completely of the ones that stayed their reproductive rate declined so it could have a negative impact on the whole population when we think of marine-protected areas for animals like dolphins this means that we have to be quite conscious about activities that we thought were benign we may need to regulate the intensity of recreational boating and actual whale watching in order to prevent these kinds of problems i 'd also like to point out that sound does n't obey boundaries so you can draw a line to try to protect an area but chemical pollution and noise pollution will continue to move through the area and i 'd like to switch now from this local familiar coastal environment to a much broader world of the baleen whales and the open ocean this is a kind of map we 've all been looking at the world is mostly blue but i 'd also like to point out that the oceans are much more connected than we think notice how few barriers there are to movement across all of the oceans compared to land to me the most mind-bending example of the interconnectedness of the ocean comes from an acoustic experiment where oceanographers took a ship to the southern indian ocean deployed an underwater loudspeaker and played back a sound that same sound traveled to the west and could be heard in bermuda and traveled to the east and could be heard in monterey [UNK] the same sound so we live in a world of satellite communication are used to global communication but it 's still amazing to me the ocean has properties that allow low-frequency sound to basically move globally the acoustic transit time for each of these paths is about three hours it 's nearly halfway around the globe in the early '70s roger payne and an ocean acoustician published a theoretical paper pointing out that it was possible that sound could transmit over these large areas but very few biologists believed it it actually turns out though even though we 've only known of long-range propagation for a few decades the whales clearly have evolved over tens of millions of years a way to exploit this amazing property of the ocean so blue whales and fin whales produce very low-frequency sounds that can travel over very long ranges the top plot here shows a complicated series of calls that are repeated by males they form songs and they appear to play a role in reproduction sort of like that of song birds down below here we see calls made by both males and females that also carry over very long ranges the biologists continued to be skeptical of the long-range communication issue well past the '70s until the end of the cold war what happened was during the cold war the u.s. navy had a system that was secret at the time that they used to track russian submarines it had deep underwater microphones or hydrophones cabled to shore all wired back to a central place that could listen to sounds over the whole north atlantic and after the berlin wall fell the navy made these systems available to whale bio-acousticians to see what they could hear this is a plot from christopher clark who tracked one individual blue whale as it passed by bermuda went down to the latitude of miami and came back again it was tracked for 43 days swimming 1,700 kilometers or more than 1,000 miles this shows us both that the calls are detectable over hundreds of miles and that whales routinely swim hundreds of miles they 're ocean-based and scale animals who are communicating over much longer ranges than we had anticipated unlike fins and blues which disperse into the temperate and tropical oceans the humpbacked whales congregate in local traditional breeding grounds so they can make a sound that 's a little higher in frequency broader-band and more complicated so you 're listening to the complicated song produced by humpbacks here humpbacks when they develop the ability to sing this song they 're listening to other whales and modifying what they sing based on what they 're hearing just like song birds or the dolphin whistles i described this means that humpback song is a form of animal culture just like music for humans would be i think one of the most interesting examples of this comes from australia biologists on the east coast of australia were recording the songs of humpbacks in that area and this orange line here marks the typical songs of east coast humpbacks in '95 they all sang the normal song but in '96 they heard a few weird songs and it turned out that these strange songs were typical of west coast whales the west coast calls became more and more popular until by 1998 none of the whales sang the east coast song it was completely gone they just sang the cool new west coast song it 's as if some new hit style had completely wiped out the old-fashioned style before and with no golden oldies stations nobody sang the old ones i 'd like to briefly just show what the ocean does to these calls now you are listening to a recording made by chris clark 0.2 miles away from a humpback you can hear the full frequency range it 's quite loud you sound very nearby the next recording you 're going to hear was made of the same humpback song 50 miles away that 's shown down here you only hear the low frequencies you hear the reverberation as the sound travels over long-range in the ocean and is not quite as loud now after i play back these humpback calls i 'll play blue whale calls but they have to be sped up because they 're so low in frequency that you would n't be able to hear it otherwise here 's a blue whale call at 50 miles which was distant for the humpback it 's loud clear [UNK] you can hear it very clearly here 's the same call recorded from a hydrophone 500 miles away there 's a lot of noise which is mostly other whales but you can still hear that faint call let 's now switch and think about a potential for human impacts the most dominant sound that humans put into the ocean comes from shipping this is the sound of a ship and i 'm having to talk a little louder to talk over it imagine that whale listening from 500 miles there 's a potential problem that maybe this kind of shipping noise would prevent whales from being able to hear each other now this is something that 's been known for quite a while this is a figure from a textbook on underwater sound and on the y-axis is the loudness of average ambient noise in the deep ocean by frequency in the low frequencies this line indicates sound that comes from seismic activity of the earth up high these variable lines indicate increasing noise in this frequency range from higher wind and wave but right in the middle here where there 's a sweet spot the noise is dominated by human ships now think about it this is an amazing thing that in this frequency range where whales communicate the main source globally on our planet for the noise comes from human ships thousands of human ships distant far away just all aggregating the next slide will show what the impact this may have on the range at which whales can communicate so here we have the loudness of a call at the whale and as we get farther away the sound gets fainter and fainter now in the pre-industrial ocean as we were mentioning this whale call could be easily detected it 's louder than noise at a range of a thousand kilometers let 's now take that additional increase in noise that we saw comes from shipping all of a sudden the effective range of communication goes from a thousand kilometers to 10 kilometers now if this signal is used for males and females to find each other for mating and they 're dispersed imagine the impact this could have on the recovery of endangered populations whales also have contact calls like i described for the dolphins i 'll play the sound of a contact call used by right whales to stay in touch and this is the kind of call that is used by say right whale mothers and calves as they separate to come back again now imagine [UNK] let 's put the ship noise in the picture what 's a mother to do if the ship comes by and her calf is n't there i 'll describe a couple strategies one strategy is if your call 's down here and the noise is in this band you could shift the frequency of your call out of the noise band and communicate better susan parks of penn state has actually studied this she 's looked in the atlantic here 's data from the south atlantic here 's a typical south atlantic contact call from the '70s look what happened by 2000 to the average call same thing in the north atlantic in the '50s versus 2000 over the last 50 years as we 've put more noise into the oceans these whales have had to shift it 's as if the whole population had to shift from being basses to singing as a tenor it 's an amazing shift induced by humans over this large scale in both time and space and we now know that whales can compensate for noise by calling louder like i did when that ship was playing by waiting for silence and by shifting their call out of the noise band now there 's probably costs to calling louder or shifting the frequency away from where you want to be and there 's probably lost opportunities if we also have to wait for silence they may miss a critical opportunity to communicate so we have to be very concerned about when the noise in habitats degrades the habitat enough that the animals either have to pay too much to be able to communicate or are not able to perform critical functions it 's a really important problem and i 'm happy to say that there are several very promising developments in this area looking at the impact of shipping on whales in terms of the shipping noise the international maritime organization of the united nations has formed a group whose job is to establish guidelines for quieting ships to tell the industry how you could quiet ships and they 've already found that by being more intelligent about better propeller design you can reduce that noise by 90 percent if you actually insulate and isolate the machinery of the ship from the hull you can reduce that noise by 99 percent so at this point it 's primarily an issue of cost and standards if this group can establish standards and if the shipbuilding industry adopts them for building new ships we can now see a gradual decline in this potential problem but there 's also another problem from ships that i 'm illustrating here and that 's the problem of collision this is a whale that just squeaked by a rapidly moving container ship and avoided collision but collision is a serious problem endangered whales are killed every year by ship collision and it 's very important to try to reduce this i 'll discuss two very promising approaches the first case comes from the bay of fundy these black lines mark shipping lanes in and out of the bay of fundy the colorized area shows the risk of collision for endangered right whales because of the ships moving in this lane it turns out that this lane here goes right through a major feeding area of right whales in the summer time and it makes an area of a significant risk of collision well biologists who could n't take no for an answer went to the international maritime organization and petitioned them to say " ca n't you move that lane those are just lines on the ground ca n't you move them over to a place where there 's less of a risk " and the international maritime organization responded very strongly " these are the new lanes " the shipping lanes have been moved and as you can see the risk of collision is much lower so it 's very promising actually we can be very creative about thinking of different ways to reduce these risks another action which was just taken independently by a shipping company itself was initiated because of concerns the shipping company had about greenhouse gas emissions with global warming the maersk line looked at their competition and saw that everybody who is in shipping thinks time is money they rush as fast as they can to get to their port but then they often wait there what maersk did is they worked ways to slow down they could slow down by about 50 percent this reduced their fuel consumption by about 30 percent which saved them money and at the same time it had a significant benefit for whales it you slow down you reduce the amount of noise you make and you reduce the risk of collision so to conclude i 'd just like to point out you know the whales live in an amazing acoustic environment they 've evolved over tens of millions of years to take advantage of this and we need to be very attentive and vigilant to thinking about where things that we do may unintentionally prevent them from being able to achieve their important activities at the same time we need to be really creative in thinking of solutions to be able to help reduce these problems i hope these examples have shown some of the different directions we can take in addition to protected areas to be able to keep the ocean safe for whales to be able to continue to communicate thank you very much .so i guess it is a result of globalization that you can find coca-cola tins on top of everest and a buddhist monk in monterey and so i just came two days ago from the himalayas to your kind invitation so i would like to invite you also for a while to the himalayas themselves and to show the place where meditators like me who began with being a molecular biologist in pasteur institute and found their way to the mountains so these are a few images i was lucky to take and be there there 's the mount kailash in eastern tibet [UNK] wonderful setting this is from marlboro country this is a turquoise lake a meditator this is the hottest day of the year somewhere in eastern tibet on august 1 and the night before we camped and my tibetan friends said " we are going to sleep outside " and i said " why we have enough space in the tent " they said " yes but it 's summertime " so now we are going to speak of happiness as a frenchman i must say that there are a lot of french intellectuals that think happiness is not at all interesting i just wrote an essay on happiness and there was a controversy and someone wrote an article saying " do n't impose on us the dirty work of happiness " " we do n't care about being happy we need to live with passion we like the ups and downs of life we like our suffering because it 's so good when it ceases for a while " this is what i see from the balcony of my hermitage in the himalayas it 's about two meters by three and you are all welcome any time now let 's come to happiness or well-being and first of all you know despite what the french intellectuals say it seems that no one wakes up in the morning thinking " may i suffer the whole day " which means that somehow [UNK] consciously or not directly or indirectly in the short or the long term whatever we do whatever we hope whatever we dream [UNK] somehow is related to a deep profound desire for well-being or happiness as pascal said even the one who hangs himself somehow is looking for cessation of suffering [UNK] he finds no other way but then if you look in the literature east and west you can find incredible diversity of definition of happiness some people say i only believed in remembering the past imagining the future never the present some people say happiness is right now it 's the quality of the freshness of the present moment and that led to henri bergson the french philosopher to say " all the great thinkers of humanity have left happiness in the vague so that they could define [UNK] each of them could define their own terms " well that would be fine if it was just a secondary preoccupation in life but now if it is something that is going to determine the quality of every instant of our life then we better know what it is have some clearer idea and probably the fact that we do n't know that is why so often although we seek happiness it seems we turn our back to it although we want to avoid suffering it seems we are running somewhat towards it and that can also come from some kind of confusions one of the most common ones is happiness and pleasure but if you look at the characteristics of those two pleasure is contingent upon time upon its object upon the place it is something that [UNK] changes of nature beautiful chocolate cake first serving is delicious second one not so much then we feel disgust that 's the nature of things we get tired i used to be a fan of bach i used to play it on the guitar you know i can hear it two three five times if i had to hear it 24 hours non-stop it might be very tiring if you are feeling very cold you come near a fire it 's so wonderful then after some moments you just go a little back and then it starts burning it sort of uses itself as you experience it and also again it can [UNK] also it 's something that you [UNK] it is not something that is radiating outside like you can feel intense pleasure and some others around you can be suffering a lot now what then will be happiness and happiness of course is such a vague word so let 's say well-being and so i think the best definition according to the buddhist view is that well-being is not just a mere pleasurable sensation it is a deep sense of serenity and fulfillment a state that actually pervades and underlies all emotional states and all the joys and sorrows that can come one 's way for you that might be surprising can we have this kind of well-being while being sad in a way why not because we are speaking of a different level look at the waves coming here to shore when you are at the bottom of the wave you hit the bottom you hit the solid rock when you are surfing on the top you are all elated so you go from elation to depression [UNK] there 's no depth now if you look at the high sea there might be beautiful calm ocean like a mirror there might be storms but the depth of the ocean is still there unchanged so now how is that it can only be a state of being not just a fleeting emotion sensation even joy [UNK] that can be the spring of happiness but there 's also wicked joy you can rejoice in someone 's suffering so how do we proceed in our quest for happiness very often we look outside we think that if we could gather this and that all the conditions something that we say " everything to be happy [UNK] to have everything to be happy " that very sentence already reveals the doom of destruction of happiness to have everything if we miss something it collapses and also when things go wrong we try to fix the outside so much but our control of the outer world is limited temporary and often illusory so now look at inner conditions are n't they stronger is n't it the mind that translates the outer condition into happiness and suffering and is n't that stronger we know by experience that we can be what we call " a little paradise " and yet be completely unhappy within the dalai lama was once in portugal and there was a lot of construction going on everywhere so one evening he said " look you are doing all these things but is n't it nice also to build something within " and he said " unless that [UNK] even you get high-tech flat on the 100th floor of a super-modern and comfortable building if you are deeply unhappy within all you are going to look for is a window from which to jump " so now at the opposite we know a lot of people who in very difficult circumstances manage to keep serenity inner strength inner freedom confidence so now if the inner conditions are stronger [UNK] of course the outer conditions do influence and it 's wonderful to live longer healthier to have access to information education to be able to travel to have freedom it 's highly desirable however this is not enough those are just auxiliary help conditions the experience that translates everything is within the mind so then when we ask oneself how to nurture the condition for happiness the inner conditions and which are those which will undermine happiness so then this just needs to have some experience we have to know from ourselves there are certain states of mind that are conducive to this flourishing to this well-being what the greeks called eudaimonia flourishing there are some which are adverse to this well-being and so if we look from our own experience anger hatred jealousy arrogance obsessive desire strong grasping they do n't leave us in such a good state after we have experienced it and also they are detrimental to others ' happiness so we may consider that the more those are invading our mind and like a chain reaction the more we feel miserable we feel tormented at the opposite everyone knows deep within that an act of selfless generosity if from the distance without anyone knowing anything about it we could save a child 's life make someone happy we do n't need the recognition we do n't need any gratitude just the mere fact of doing that fills such a sense of adequation with our deep nature and we would like to be like that all the time so is that possible to change our way of being to transform one 's mind are n't those negative emotions or destructive emotions inherent to the nature of mind is change possible in our emotions in our traits in our moods for that we have to ask what is nature of mind and if we look from the experiential point of view there is a primary quality of consciousness that 's just the mere fact to be cognitive to be aware consciousness is like a mirror that allows all images to rise on it you can have ugly faces beautiful faces in the mirror the mirror allows that but the mirror is not tainted is not modified is not altered by those images likewise behind every single thought there is the bare consciousness pure awareness this is the nature it can not be tainted intrinsically with hatred or jealousy because then if it was always there [UNK] like a dye that would permeate the whole cloth [UNK] then it would be found all the time somewhere we know we 're not always angry always jealous always generous so because the basic fabric of consciousness is this pure cognitive quality that differentiates it from a stone there is a possibility for change because all emotions are fleeting that is the ground for mind training mind training is based on the idea that two opposite mental factors can not happen at the same time you could go from love to hate but you can not at the same time toward the same object the same person want to harm and want to do good you can not in the same gesture shake hand and give a blow so there are natural antidotes to emotions that are destructive to our inner well-being so that 's the way to proceed rejoicing compared to jealousy a kind of sense of inner freedom as opposite to intense grasping and obsession benevolence loving kindness against hatred but of course each emotion then would need a particular antidote another way is to try to find a general antidote to all emotions and that 's by looking at the very nature usually when we feel annoyed hatred or upset with someone or obsessed with something the mind goes again and again to that object each time it goes to the object it reinforces that obsession or that annoyance so then it 's a self-perpetuating process so what we need to look now is instead of looking outward we look inward look at anger itself it looks very menacing like a billowing monsoon cloud or thunderstorm but we think we could sit on the cloud [UNK] but if you go there it 's just mist likewise if you look at the thought of anger it will vanish like frost under the morning sun if you do this again and again the propensity the tendencies for anger to arise again will be less and less each time you dissolve it and at the end although it may rise it will just cross the mind like a bird crossing the sky without leaving any track so this is the principal of mind training now it takes time because we [UNK] it took time for all those faults in our mind the tendencies to build up so it will take time to unfold them as well but that 's the only way to go mind transformation [UNK] that is the very meaning of meditation it means familiarization with a new way of being new way of perceiving things which is more in adequation with reality with interdependence with the stream and continuous transformation which our being and our consciousness is so the interface with cognitive science since we need to come to that and it was i suppose the subject of [UNK] we have to deal in such a short time with brain plasticity the brain was thought to be more or less fixed all the nominal connections in numbers and quantities were thought [UNK] until the last 20 years [UNK] thought to be more or less fixed when we reached adult age now recently it has been found that it can change a lot a violinist as we heard who has done 10,000 hours of violin practice some area that controls the movements of fingers in the brain change a lot increasing reinforcement of the synaptic connections so can we do that with human qualities with loving kindness with patience with openness so that 's what those great meditators have been doing some of them who came to the labs like in madison wisconsin or in berkeley did 20 to 40,000 hours of meditation they do like three years ' retreat where they do meditate 12 hours a day and then the rest of their life they will do that three or four hours a day they are real olympic champions of mind training this is the place where the meditators [UNK] you can see it 's kind of inspiring now here with 256 electrodes so what did they find of course same thing the scientific embargo [UNK] if ever has been to submitted to " nature " hopefully it will be accepted it deals with the state of compassion unconditional compassion we asked meditators who have been doing that for years and years and years to put their mind in a state where there 's nothing but loving kindness total availability to sentient being of course during the training we do that with objects we think of people suffering we think of people we love but at some point it can be a state which is all pervading here is the preliminary result which i can show because it 's already been shown the bell curve shows 150 controls and what is being looked at is the difference between the right and the left frontal lobe in very short people who have more activity in the right side of the prefrontal cortex are more depressed withdrawn they do n't describe a lot of positive affect it 's the opposite on the left side more tendency to altruism to happiness to express and curiosity and so forth so there 's a basic line for people and also it can be changed if you see a comic movie you go off to the left side if you are happy about something you 'll go more to the left side if you have a bout of depression you 'll go to the right side here the -0.5 is the full standard deviation of a meditator who meditated on compassion it 's something that is totally out of the bell curve so i 've no time to go into all the different scientific results hopefully they will come but they found that [UNK] this is after three and a half hours in an fmri it 's like coming out of a space ship also it has been shown in other labs [UNK] for instance paul ekman 's labs in berkeley [UNK] that some meditators are able also to control their emotional response more than it could be thought like the startle experiments for example if you sit a guy on a chair with all this kind of apparatus measuring your physiology and there 's kind of a bomb that goes off it 's so instinctive response that in 20 years they never saw anyone who will not jump some meditators without trying to stop it but simply by being completely open thinking that that bang is just going to be just a small event like a shooting star they are able not to move at all so the whole point of that is not sort of to make like a circus thing of showing exceptional beings who can jump or whatever it 's more to say that mind training matters that this is not just a luxury this is not a supplementary vitamin for the soul this is something that 's going to determine the quality of every instant of our lives we are ready to spend 15 years achieving education we love to do jogging fitness we do all kinds of things to remain beautiful yet we spend surprisingly little time taking care of what matters most [UNK] the way our mind functions [UNK] which again is the ultimate thing that determines the quality of our experience now our compassion is supposed to be put in action that 's what we try to do in different places just this one example is worth a lot of work this lady with bone tb left alone in a tent is going to die with her only daughter one year later how she is different schools and clinics we 've been doing in tibet and just i leave you with the beauty of those looks that tells more about happiness than i could ever say and jumping monks of tibet flying monks thank you very much .those of you who may remember me from tedglobal remember me asking a few questions which still preoccupy me one of them was why is it necessary to spend six billion pounds speeding up the eurostar train when for about 10 percent of that money you could have top supermodels male and female serving free chateau petrus to all the passengers for the entire duration of the journey you 'd still have five billion left in change and people would ask for the trains to be slowed down now you may remember me asking the question as well a very interesting observation that actually those strange little signs that actually flash " 35 " at you occasionally accompanying a little smiley face or a frown according to whether you 're within or outside the speed limit [UNK] those are actually more effective at preventing road accidents than speed cameras which come with the actual threat of real punishment so there seems to be a strange disproportionality at work i think in many areas of human problem solving particularly those which involve human psychology which is the tendency of the organization or the institution is to deploy as much force as possible as much compulsion as possible whereas actually the tendency of the person is to be almost influenced in absolute reverse proportion to the amount of force being applied so there seems to be a complete disconnect here so what i 'm asking for is the creation of a new job title [UNK] i 'll come to this a little later [UNK] and perhaps the addition of a new word into the english language because it does seem to me that large organizations including government which is of course the largest organization of all have actually become completely disconnected with what actually matters to people let me give you one example of this you may remember this as the aol-time warner merger okay heralded at the time as the largest single deal of all time it may still be for all i know now all of you in this room in one form or other are probably customers of one or both of those organizations that merged just interested did anybody notice anything different as a result of this at all so unless you happened to be a shareholder of one or the other organizations or one of the dealmakers or lawyers involved in the no-doubt lucrative activity you 're actually engaging in a huge piece of activity that meant absolutely bugger-all to anybody okay by contrast years of marketing have taught me that if you actually want people to remember you and to appreciate what you do the most potent things are actually very very small this is from virgin atlantic upper-class it 's the cruet salt and pepper set quite nice in itself they 're little sort of airplane things what 's really really sweet is every single person looking at these things has exactly the same mischievous thought which is " i reckon i can heist these " however you pick them up and underneath actually engraved in the metal are the words " stolen from virgin atlantic airways upper-class " now years after you remember the strategic question of whether you 're flying in a 777 or an airbus you remember those words and that experience similarly this is from a hotel in stockholm the lydmar has anybody stayed there it 's the lift it 's a series of buttons in the lift nothing unusual about that at all except that these are actually not the buttons that take you to an individual floor it starts with garage at the bottom i suppose appropriately but it does n't go up garage grand floor mezzanine one two three four it actually says garage funk rhythm and blues you have a series of buttons you actually choose your lift music my guess is that the cost of installing this in the lift in the lydmar hotel in stockholm is probably 500 to 1,000 pounds max it 's frankly more memorable than all those millions of hotels we 've all stayed at that tell you that your room has actually been recently renovated at a cost of 500,000 dollars in order to make it resemble every other hotel room you 've ever stayed in in the entire course of your life now these are trivial marketing examples i accept but i was at a ted event recently and esther duflo probably one of the leading experts in effectively the eradication of poverty in the developing world actually spoke and she came across a similar example of something that fascinated me as being something which in a business context or a government context would simply be so trivial a solution as to seem embarrassing it was simply to encourage the inoculation of children by not only making it a social event [UNK] i think good use of behavioral economics in that if you turn up with several other mothers to have your child inoculated your sense of confidence is much greater than if you turn up alone but secondly to incentivize that inoculation by giving a kilo of lentils to everybody who participated it 's a tiny tiny thing if you 're a senior person at unesco and someone says " so what are you doing to eradicate world poverty " you 're not really confident standing up there saying " i 've got it cracked it 's the lentils " are you our own sense of self-aggrandizement feels that big important problems need to have big important and most of all expensive solutions attached to them and yet what behavioral economics shows time after time after time is in human behavioral and behavioral change there 's a very very strong disproportionality at work that actually what changes our behavior and what changes our attitude to things is not actually proportionate to the degree of expense entailed or the degree of force that 's applied but everything about institutions makes them uncomfortable with that disproportionality so what happens in an institution is the very person who has the power to solve the problem also has a very very large budget and once you have a very very large budget you actually look for expensive things to spend it on what is completely lacking is a class of people who have immense amounts of power but no money at all it 's those people i 'd quite like to create in the world going forward now here 's another thing that happens which is what i call sometimes " terminal 5 syndrome " which is that big expensive things get big highly-intelligent attention and they 're great and terminal 5 is absolutely magnificent until you get down to the small detail the usability which is the signage which is catastrophic you come out of " arrive " at the airport and you follow a big yellow sign that says " trains " and it 's in front of you so you walk for another hundred yards expecting perhaps another sign that might courteously be yellow in front of you and saying " trains " no no no the next one is actually blue to your left and says " heathrow express " i mean it could almost be rather like that scene from the film " airplane " a yellow sign that 's exactly what they 'll be expecting actually what happens in the world increasingly [UNK] now all credit to the british airport authority i spoke about this before and a brilliant person got in touch with me and said " okay what can you do " so i did come up with five suggestions which they are actually actioning one of them also being although logically it 's quite a good idea to have a lift with no up and down button in it if it only serves two floors it 's actually bloody terrifying okay because when the door closes and there 's nothing for you to do you 've actually just stepped into a hammer film so these questions 1 what is happening in the world is the big stuff actually is done magnificently well but the small stuff what you might call the user interface is done spectacularly badly but also there seems to be a complete sort of gridlock in terms of solving these small solutions because the people who can actually solve them actually are too powerful and too preoccupied with something they think of as " strategy " to actually solve them i tried this exercise recently talking about banking they said " can we do an advertising campaign what can we do and encourage more online banking " i said " it 's really really easy " i said " when people login to their online bank there are lots and lots of things they 'd probably quite like to look at the last thing in the world you ever want to see is your balance " i 've got friends who actually never use their own bank cash machines because there 's the risk that it might display their balance on the screen why would you willingly expose yourself to bad news okay you simply would n't i said " if you make actually 'tell me my balance ' if you make that an option rather than the default you 'll find twice as many people log on to online banking and they do it three times as often " let 's face it most of us [UNK] how many of you actually check your balance before you remove cash from a cash machine and you 're pretty rich by the standards of the world at large now interesting that no single person does that or at least can admit to being so anal as to do it but what 's interesting about that suggestion was that to implement that suggestion would n't cost 10 million pounds it would n't involve large amounts of expenditure it would actually cost about 50 quid and yet it never happens because there 's a fundamental disconnect as i said that actually the people with the power want to do big expensive things and there 's to some extent a big strategy myth that 's prevalent in business now and if you think about it it 's very very important that the strategy myth is maintained because if the board of directors convince everybody that the success of any organization is almost entirely dependent on the decisions made by the board of directors it makes the disparity in salaries slightly more justifiable than if you actually acknowledge that quite a lot of the credit for a company 's success might actually lie somewhere else in small pieces of tactical activity but what is happening is that effectively [UNK] and the invention of the spreadsheet has n't helped this lots of things have n't helped this [UNK] business and government suffers from a kind of physics envy it wants the world to be the kind of place where the input and the change are proportionate it 's a kind of mechanistic world that we 'd all love to live in where effectively it sits very nicely on spreadsheets everything is numerically expressible and the amount you spend on something is proportionate to the scale of your success that 's the world people actually want in truth we do live in a world that science can understand unfortunately the science is probably closer to being climatology in that in many cases very very small changes can have disproportionately huge effects and equally vast areas of activity enormous mergers can actually accomplish absolutely bugger-all but it 's very very uncomfortable for us to actually acknowledge that we 're living in such a world but what i 'm saying is we could just make things a little bit better for ourselves if we looked at it in this very simple four-way approach that is actually strategy and i 'm not denying that strategy has a role you know there are cases where you spend quite a lot of money and you accomplish quite a lot and i 'd be wrong to dis that completely moving over we come of course to consultancy i thought it was very indecent of accenture to ditch tiger woods in such a sort of hurried and hasty way i mean tiger surely was actually obeying the accenture model he developed an interesting outsourcing model for sexual services no longer tied to a single monopoly provider in many cases sourcing things locally and of course the ability to have between one and three girls delivered at any time led for better load-balancing so what accenture suddenly found so unattractive about that i 'm not sure then there are other things that do n't cost much and achieve absolutely nothing that 's called trivia but there 's a fourth thing and the fundamental problem is we do n't actually have a word for this stuff we do n't know what to call it and actually we do n't spend nearly enough money looking for those things looking for those tiny things that may or may not work but which if they do work can have a success absolutely out of proportion to their expense their efforts and the disruption they cause so the first thing i 'd like is a competition [UNK] to anybody watching this as a film [UNK] is to come up with a name for that stuff on the bottom right and the second thing i think is that the world needs to have people in charge of that that 's why i call for the " chief detail officer " every corporation should have one and every government should have a ministry of detail the people who actually have no money who have no extravagant budget but who realize that actually you might achieve greater success in uptake of a government program by actually doubling the level of benefits you pay but you 'll probably achieve exactly that same effect simply by redesigning the form and writing it in comprehensible english and if actually we created a ministry of detail and business actually had chief detail officers then that fourth quadrant which is so woefully neglected at the moment might finally get the attention it deserves thank you very much .we 're here today to announce the first synthetic cell a cell made by starting with the digital code in the computer building the chromosome from four bottles of chemicals assembling that chromosome in yeast transplanting it into a recipient bacterial cell and transforming that cell into a new bacterial species so this is the first self-replicating species that we 've had on the planet whose parent is a computer it also is the first species to have its own website encoded in its genetic code but we 'll talk more about the watermarks in a minute this is a project that had its inception 15 years ago when our team then [UNK] we called the institute tigr [UNK] was involved in sequencing the first two genomes in history we did haemophilus influenzae and then the smallest genome of a self-replicating organism that of mycoplasma genitalium and as soon as we had these two sequences we thought if this is supposed to be the smallest genome of a self-replicating species could there be even a smaller genome could we understand the basis of cellular life at the genetic level it 's been a 15-year quest just to get to the starting point now to be able to answer those questions because it 's very difficult to eliminate multiple genes from a cell you can only do them one at a time we decided early on that we had to take a synthetic route even though nobody had been there before to see if we could synthesize a bacterial chromosome so we could actually vary the gene content to understand the essential genes for life that started our 15-year quest to get here but before we did the first experiments we actually asked art caplan 's team at the university of pennsylvania to undertake a review of what the risks the challenges the ethics around creating new species in the laboratory were because it had n't been done before they spent about two years reviewing that independently and published their results in science in 1999 ham and i took two years off as a side project to sequence the human genome but as soon as that was done we got back to the task at hand in 2002 we started a new institute the institute for biological energy alternatives where we set out two goals one to understand the impact of our technology on the environment and how to understand the environment better and two to start down this process of making synthetic life to understand basic life in 2003 we published our first success so ham smith and clyde hutchison developed some new methods for making error-free dna at a small level our first task was a 5,000-letter code bacteriophage a virus that attacks only e. coli so that was the phage phi x 174 which was chosen for historical reasons it was the first dna phage dna virus dna genome that was actually sequenced so once we realized that we could make 5,000-base pair viral-sized pieces we thought we at least have the means then to try and make serially lots of these pieces to be able to eventually assemble them together to make this mega base chromosome so substantially larger than we even thought we would go initially there were several steps to this there were two sides we had to solve the chemistry for making large dna molecules and we had to solve the biological side of how if we had this new chemical entity how would we boot it up activate it in a recipient cell we had two teams working in parallel one team on the chemistry and the other on trying to entire chromosomes to get new cells when we started this out we thought the synthesis would be the biggest problem which is why we chose the smallest genome and some of you have noticed that we switched from the smallest genome to a much larger one and we can walk through the reasons for that but basically the small cell took on the order of one to two months to get results from whereas the larger faster-growing cell takes only two days so there 's only so many cycles we could go through in a year at six weeks per cycle and you should know that basically 99 probably 99 percent plus of our experiments failed so this was a debugging problem-solving scenario from the beginning because there was no recipe of how to get there so one of the most important publications we had was in 2007 carole lartigue led the effort to actually transplant a bacterial chromosome from one bacteria to another i think philosophically that was one of the most important papers that we 've ever done because it showed how dynamic life was and we knew once that worked that we actually had a chance if we could make the synthetic chromosomes to do the same with those we did n't know that it was going to take us several years more to get there in 2008 we reported the complete synthesis of the mycoplasma genitalium genome a little over 500,000 letters of genetic code but we have not yet succeeded in booting up that chromosome we think in part because of its slow growth and in part cells have all kinds of unique defense mechanisms to keep these events from happening it turned out the cell that we were trying to transplant into had a nuclease an enzyme that chews up dna on its surface and was happy to eat the synthetic dna that we gave it and never got transplantations but at the time that was the largest molecule of a defined structure that had been made and so both sides were progressing but part of the synthesis had to be accomplished or was able to be accomplished using yeast putting the fragments in yeast and yeast would assemble these for us it 's an amazing step forward but we had a problem because now we had the bacterial chromosomes growing in yeast so in addition to doing the transplant we had to find out how to get a bacterial chromosome out of the eukaryotic yeast into a form where we could transplant it into a recipient cell so our team developed new techniques for actually growing cloning entire bacterial chromosomes in yeast so we took the same mycoides genome that carole had initially transplanted and we grew that in yeast as an artificial chromosome and we thought this would be a great test bed for learning how to get chromosomes out of yeast and transplant them when we did these experiments though we could get the chromosome out of yeast but it would n't transplant and boot up a cell that little issue took the team two years to solve it turns out the dna in the bacterial cell was actually methylated and the methylation protects it from the restriction enzyme from digesting the dna so what we found is if we took the chromosome out of yeast and methylated it we could then transplant it further advances came when the team removed the restriction enzyme genes from the recipient capricolum cell and once we had done that now we can take naked dna out of yeast and transplant it so last fall when we published the results of that work in science we all became overconfident and were sure we were only a few weeks away from being able to now boot up a chromosome out of yeast because of the problems with mycoplasma genitalium and its slow growth about a year and a half ago we decided to synthesize the much larger chromosome the mycoides chromosome knowing that we had the biology worked out on that for transplantation and dan led the team for the synthesis of this over one-million-base pair chromosome but it turned out it was n't going to be as simple in the end and it set us back three months because we had one error out of over a million base pairs in that sequence so the team developed new debugging software where we could test each synthetic fragment to see if it would grow in a background of wild type dna and we found that 10 out of the 11 100,000-base pair pieces we synthesized were completely accurate and compatible with a life-forming sequence we narrowed it down to one fragment we sequenced it and found just one base pair had been deleted in an essential gene so accuracy is essential there 's parts of the genome where it can not tolerate even a single error and then there 's parts of the genome where we can put in large blocks of dna as we did with the watermarks and it can tolerate all kinds of errors so it took about three months to find that error and repair it and then early one morning at 6 a.m. we got a text from dan saying that now the first blue colonies existed so it 's been a long route to get here 15 years from the beginning we felt one of the tenets of this field was to make absolutely certain we could distinguish synthetic dna from natural dna early on when you 're working in a new area of science you have to think about all the pitfalls and things that could lead you to believe that you had done something when you had n't and even worse leading others to believe it so we thought the worst problem would be a single molecule contamination of the native chromosome leading us to believe that we actually had created a synthetic cell when it would have been just a contaminant so early on we developed the notion of putting in watermarks in the dna to absolutely make clear that the dna was synthetic and the first chromosome we built in 2008 [UNK] the 500,000-base pair one [UNK] we simply assigned the names of the authors of the chromosome into the genetic code but it was using just amino acid single letter translations which leaves out certain letters of the alphabet so the team actually developed a new code within the code within the code so it 's a new code for interpreting and writing messages in dna now mathematicians have been hiding and writing messages in the genetic code for a long time but it 's clear they were mathematicians and not biologists because if you write long messages with the code that the mathematicians developed it would more than likely lead to new proteins being synthesized with unknown functions so the code that mike montague and the team developed actually puts frequent stop codons so it 's a different alphabet but allows us to use the entire english alphabet with punctuation and numbers so there are four major watermarks all over 1,000 base pairs of genetic code the first one actually contains within it this code for interpreting the rest of the genetic code so in the remaining information in the watermarks contain the names of i think it 's 46 different authors and key contributors to getting the project to this stage and we also built in a website address so that if somebody decodes the code within the code within the code they can send an email to that address so it 's clearly distinguishable from any other species having 46 names in it its own web address and we added three quotations because with the first genome we were criticized for not trying to say something more profound than just signing the work so we wo n't give the rest of the code but we will give the three quotations the first is " to live to err to fall to triumph and to recreate life out of life " it 's a james joyce quote the second quotation is " see things not as they are but as they might be " it 's a quote from the " american prometheus " book on robert oppenheimer and the last one is a richard feynman quote " what i can not build i can not understand " so because this is as much a philosophical advance as a technical advance in science we tried to deal with both the philosophical and the technical side the last thing i want to say before turning it over to questions is that the extensive work that we 've done [UNK] asking for ethical review pushing the envelope on that side as well as the technical side [UNK] this has been broadly discussed in the scientific community in the policy community and at the highest levels of the federal government even with this announcement as we did in 2003 [UNK] that work was funded by the department of energy so the work was reviewed at the level of the white house trying to decide whether to classify the work or publish it and they came down on the side of open publication which is the right approach [UNK] we 've briefed the white house we 've briefed members of congress we 've tried to take and push the policy issues in parallel with the scientific advances so with that i would like to open it first to the floor for questions yes in the back reporter could you explain in layman 's terms how significant a breakthrough this is please craig venter can we explain how significant this is i 'm not sure we 're the ones that should be explaining how significant it is it 's significant to us perhaps it 's a giant philosophical change in how we view life we actually view it as a baby step in terms of it 's taken us 15 years to be able to do the experiment we wanted to do 15 years ago on understanding life at its basic level but we actually believe this is going to be a very powerful set of tools and we 're already starting in numerous avenues to use this tool we have at the institute ongoing funding now from nih in a program with novartis to try and use these new synthetic dna tools to perhaps make the flu vaccine that you might get next year because instead of taking weeks to months to make these dan 's team can now make these in less than 24 hours so when you see how long it took to get an h1n1 vaccine out we think we can shorten that process quite substantially in the vaccine area synthetic genomics and the institute are forming a new vaccine company because we think these tools can affect vaccines to diseases that have n't been possible to date things where the viruses rapidly evolve such with rhinovirus would n't it be nice to have something that actually blocked common colds or more importantly hiv where the virus evolves so quickly the vaccines that are made today ca n't keep up with those evolutionary changes also at synthetic genomics we 've been working on major environmental issues i think this latest oil spill in the gulf is a reminder we ca n't see co2 [UNK] we depend on scientific measurements for it and we see the beginning results of having too much of it [UNK] but we can see pre-co2 now floating on the waters and contaminating the beaches in the gulf we need some alternatives for oil we have a program with exxon mobile to try and develop new strains of algae that can efficiently capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or from concentrated sources make new hydrocarbons that can go into their refineries to make normal gasoline and diesel fuel out of co2 those are just a couple of the approaches and directions that we 're taking .this is my first time at ted normally as an advertising man i actually speak at ted evil which is ted 's secret sister that pays all the bills it 's held every two years in burma and i particularly remember a really good speech by kim jong il on how to get teens smoking again but actually it 's suddenly come to me after years working in the business that what we create in advertising which is intangible value [UNK] you might call it perceived value you might call it badge value subjective value intangible value of some kind [UNK] gets rather a bad rap if you think about it if you want to live in a world in the future where there are fewer material goods you basically have two choices you can either live in a world which is poorer which people in general do n't like or you can live in a world where actually intangible value constitutes a greater part of overall value that actually intangible value in many ways is a very very fine substitute for using up labor or limited resources in the creation of things here is one example this is a train which goes from london to paris the question was given to a bunch of engineers about 15 years ago " how do we make the journey to paris better " and they came up with a very good engineering solution which was to spend six billion pounds building completely new tracks from london to the coast and knocking about 40 minutes off a three-and-half-hour journey time now call me mister picky i 'm just an ad man 1 1 but it strikes me as a slightly unimaginative way of improving a train journey merely to make it shorter now what is the hedonic opportunity cost on spending six billion pounds on those railway tracks here is my naive advertising man 's suggestion what you should in fact do is employ all of the world 's top male and female supermodels pay them to walk the length of the train handing out free chateau petrus for the entire duration of the journey now you 'll still have about three billion pounds left in change and people will ask for the trains to be slowed down now here is another naive advertising man 's question again and this shows that engineers medical people scientific people have an obsession with solving the problems of reality when actually most problems once you reach a basic level of wealth in society most problems are actually problems of perception so i 'll ask you another question what on earth is wrong with placebos they seem fantastic to me they cost very little to develop they work extraordinarily well they have no side effects or if they do they 're imaginary so you can safely ignore them so i was discussing this and i actually went to the marginal revolution blog by tyler cowen i do n't know if anybody knows it someone was actually suggesting that you can take this concept further and actually produce placebo education the point is that education does n't actually work by teaching you things it actually works by giving you the impression that you 've had a very good education which gives you an insane sense of unwarranted self-confidence which then makes you very very successful in later life so welcome to oxford ladies and gentlemen but actually the point of placebo education is interesting how many problems of life can be solved actually by tinkering with perception rather than that tedious hardworking and messy business of actually trying to change reality here 's a great example from history i 've heard this attributed to several other kings but doing a bit of historical research it seems to be fredrick the great fredrick the great of prussia was very very keen for the germans to adopt the potato and to eat it because he realized that if you had two sources of carbohydrate wheat and potatoes you get less price volatility in bread and you get a far lower risk of famine because you actually had two crops to fall back on not one the only problem is potatoes if you think about it look pretty disgusting and also 18th century prussians ate very very few vegetables [UNK] rather like contemporary scottish people so actually he tried making it compulsory the prussian peasantry said " we ca n't even get the dogs to eat these damn things they are absolutely disgusting and they 're good for nothing " there are even records of people being executed for refusing to grow potatoes so he tried plan b he tried the marketing solution which is he declared the potato as a royal vegetable and none but the royal family could consume it and he planted it in a royal potato patch with guards who had instructions to guard over it night and day but with secret instructions not to guard it very well now 18th century peasants know that there is one pretty safe rule in life which is if something is worth guarding it 's worth stealing before long there was a massive underground potato-growing operation in germany what he 'd effectively done is he 'd re-branded the potato it was an absolute masterpiece i told this story and a gentleman from turkey came up to me and said " very very good marketer fredrick the great but not a patch on ataturk " ataturk rather like nicolas sarkozy was very keen to discourage the wearing of a veil in turkey to modernize it now boring people would have just simply banned the veil but that would have ended up with a lot of awful kickback and a hell of a lot of resistance ataturk was a lateral thinker he made it compulsory for prostitutes to wear the veil i ca n't verify that fully but it does not matter there is your environmental problem solved by the way guys all convicted child molesters have to drive a porsche cayenne what ataturk realized actually is two very fundamental things which is that actually first one all value is actually relative all value is perceived value for those of you who do n't speak spanish jugo de naranja [UNK] it 's actually the spanish for " orange juice " because actually it 's not the dollar it 's actually the peso in buenos aires very clever buenos aires street vendors decided to practice price discrimination to the detriment of any passing gringo tourists as an advertising man i have to admire that but the first thing is that all value is subjective second point is that persuasion is often better than compulsion these funny signs that flash your speed at you some of the new ones on the bottom right now actually show a smiley face or a frowny face to act as an emotional trigger what 's fascinating about these signs is they cost about 10 percent of the running cost of a conventional speed camera but they prevent twice as many accidents so the bizarre thing which is baffling to conventional classically trained economists is that a weird little smiley face has a better effect on changing your behavior than the threat of a £60 fine and three penalty points tiny little behavioral economics detail in italy penalty points go backwards you start with 12 and they take them away because they found that loss aversion is a more powerful influence on people 's behavior in britain we tend to feel " whoa 1 got another three 1 " not so in italy another fantastic case of creating intangible value to replace actual or material value which remember is what after all the environmental movement needs to be about this again is from prussia from i think about 1812 1813 the wealthy prussians to help in the war against the french were encouraged to give in all their jewelry and it was replaced with replica jewelry made of cast iron here 's one " gold gab ich für eisen 1813 " the interesting thing is that for 50 years hence the highest status jewelry you could wear in prussia was n't made of gold or diamonds it was made of cast iron because actually never mind the actual intrinsic value of having gold jewelry this actually had symbolic value badge value it said that your family had made a great sacrifice in the past so the modern equivalent would of course be this but actually there is a thing just as there are veblen goods where the value of the good depends on it being expensive and rare [UNK] there are opposite kind of things where actually the value in them depends on them being ubiquitous classless and minimalistic if you think about it shakerism was a proto-environmental movement adam smith talks about 18th century america where the prohibition against visible displays of wealth was so great it was almost a block in the economy in new england because even wealthy farmers could find nothing to spend their money on without incurring the displeasure of their neighbors it 's perfectly possible to create these social pressures which lead to more egalitarian societies what 's also interesting if you look at products that have a high component of what you might call messaging value a high component of intangible value versus their intrinsic value they are often quite egalitarian in terms of dress denim is perhaps the perfect example of something which replaces material value with symbolic value coca-cola a bunch of you may be a load of pinkos and you may not like the coca-cola company but it 's worth remembering andy warhol 's point about coke what warhol said about coke is he said " what i really like about coca-cola is the president of the united states ca n't get a better coke than the bum on the corner of the street " now that is actually when you think about it [UNK] we take it for granted [UNK] it 's actually a remarkable achievement to produce something that 's that democratic now we basically have to change our views slightly there is a basic view that real value involves making things involves labor it involves engineering it involves limited raw materials and that what we add on top is kind of false it 's a fake version and there is a reason for some suspicion and uncertainly about it it patently veers toward propaganda however what we do have now is a much more variegated media ecosystem in which to kind of create this kind of value and it 's much fairer when i grew up this was basically the media environment of my childhood as translated into food you had a monopoly supplier on the left you have rupert murdoch or the bbc and on your right you have a dependent public which is pathetically grateful for anything you give it nowadays the user is actually involved this is actually what 's called in the digital world " user-generated content " although it 's called agriculture in the world of food this is actually called a mash-up where you take content that someone else has produced and you do something new with it in the world of food we call it cooking this is food 2.0 which is food you produce for the purpose of sharing it with other people this is mobile food british are very good at that fish and chips in newspaper the cornish pasty the pie the sandwich we invented the whole lot of them we 're not very good at food in general italians do great food but it 's not very portable generally i only learned this the other day the earl of sandwich did n't invent the sandwich he actually invented the toasty but then the earl of toasty would be a ridiculous name finally we have contextual communication now the reason i show you pernod [UNK] it 's only one example every country has a contextual alcoholic drink in france it 's pernod it tastes great within the borders of that country but absolute shite if you take it anywhere else unicum in hungary for example the greeks have actually managed to produce something called retsina which even tastes shite when you 're in greece but so much communication now is contextual that the capacity for actually nudging people for giving them better information [UNK] b.j fogg at the university of stanford makes the point that actually the mobile phone is [UNK] he 's invented the phrase " persuasive technologies " he believes the mobile phone by being location-specific contextual timely and immediate is simply the greatest persuasive technology device ever invented now if we have all these tools at our disposal we simply have to ask the question and thaler and sunstein have of how we can use these more intelligently i 'll give you one example if you had a large red button of this kind on the wall of your home and every time you pressed it it saved 50 dollars for you put 50 dollars into your pension you would save a lot more the reason is that the interface fundamentally determines the behavior okay now marketing has done a very very good job of creating opportunities for impulse buying yet we 've never created the opportunity for impulse saving if you did this more people would save more it 's simply a question of changing the interface by which people make decisions and the very nature of the decisions changes obviously i do n't want people to do this because as an advertising man i tend to regard saving as just consumerism needlessly postponed but if anybody did want to do that that 's the kind of thing we need to be thinking about actually fundamental opportunities to change human behavior now i 've got an example here from canada there was a young intern at ogilvy canada called hunter somerville who was working in improv in toronto and got a part-time job in advertising and was given the job of advertising shreddies now this is the most perfect case of creating intangible added value without changing the product in the slightest shreddies is a strange square whole-grain cereal only available in new zealand canada and britain it 's kraft 's peculiar way of rewarding loyalty to the crown in working out how you could re-launch shreddies he came up with this video man shreddies is supposed to be square woman have any of these diamond shapes gone out voiceover new diamond shreddies cereal same 100 percent whole-grain wheat in a delicious diamond shape rory sutherland i 'm not sure this is n't the most perfect example of intangible value creation all it requires is photons neurons and a great idea to create this thing i would say it 's a work of genius but naturally you ca n't do this kind of thing without a little bit of market research man so shreddies is actually producing a new product which is something very exciting for them so they are introducing new diamond shreddies so i just want to get your first impressions when you see that when you see the diamond shreddies box there woman were n't they square woman # 2 i 'm a little bit confused woman # 3 they look like the squares to me man they [UNK] yeah it 's all in the appearance but it 's kind of like flipping a six or a nine like a six if you flip it over it looks like a nine but a six is very different from a nine woman # 3 or an " m " and a " w " man an " m " and a " w " exactly man # 2 [ unclear ] you just looked like you turned it on its end but when you see it like that it 's more interesting looking man just try both of them take a square one there first man which one did you prefer man # 2 the first one man the first one rory sutherland now naturally a debate raged there were conservative elements in canada unsurprisingly who actually resented this intrusion so eventually the manufacturers actually arrived at a compromise which was the combo pack if you think it 's funny bear in mind there is an organization called the american institute of wine economics which actually does extensive research into perception of things and discovers that except for among perhaps five or ten percent of the most knowledgeable people there is no correlation between quality and enjoyment in wine except when you tell the people how expensive it is in which case they tend to enjoy the more expensive stuff more so drink your wine blind in the future but this is both hysterically funny [UNK] but i think an important philosophical point which is going forward we need more of this kind of value we need to spend more time appreciating what already exists and less time agonizing over what else we can do two quotations to more or less end with one of them is " poetry is when you make new things familiar and familiar things new " which is n't a bad definition of what our job is to help people appreciate what is unfamiliar but also to gain a greater appreciation and place a far higher value on those things which are already existing there is some evidence by the way that things like social networking help do that because they help people share news they give badge value to everyday little trivial activities so they actually reduce the need for actually spending great money on display and increase the kind of third-party enjoyment you can get from the smallest simplest things in life which is magic the second one is the second g.k. chesterton quote of this session which is " we are perishing for want of wonder not for want of wonders " which i think for anybody involved in technology is perfectly true and a final thing when you place a value on things like health love sex and other things and learn to place a material value on what you 've previously discounted for being merely intangible a thing not seen you realize you 're much much wealthier than you ever imagined thank you very much indeed
